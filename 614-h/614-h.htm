<h2>TO PAUL BOURGET</h2>
<p>Traveller and student and curious as you are, you will never
have heard the name of Vailima, most likely not even that of
Upolu, and Samoa itself may be strange to your ears.&nbsp; To
these barbaric seats there came the other day a yellow book with
your name on the title, and filled in every page with the
exquisite gifts of your art.&nbsp; Let me take and change your
own words: <i>J&rsquo;ai beau admirer les autres de toutes mes
forces</i>, <i>c&rsquo;est avez vous que je me complais &agrave;
vivre</i>.</p>

<h2>LETTER TO THE AUTHOR</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Stevenson</span>,</p>
<p>You have trusted me with the choice and arrangement of these
papers, written before you departed to the South Seas, and have
asked me to add a preface to the volume.&nbsp; But it is your
prose the public wish to read, not mine; and I am sure they will
willingly be spared the preface.&nbsp; Acknowledgements are due
in your name to the publishers of the several magazines from
which the papers are collected, viz. <i>Fraser&rsquo;s</i>,
<i>Longman&rsquo;s</i>, the <i>Magazine of Art</i>, and
<i>Scribner&rsquo;s</i>.&nbsp; I will only add, lest any reader
should find the tone of the concluding pieces less inspiriting
than your wont, that they were written under circumstances of
especial gloom and sickness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I agree with you the
lights seem a little turned down,&rdquo; so you write to me now;
&ldquo;the truth is I was far through, and came none too soon to
the South Seas, where I was to recover peace of body and
mind.&nbsp; And however low the lights, the stuff is true . .
.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, inasmuch as the South Seas sirens have
breathed new life into you, we are bound to be heartily grateful
to them, though as they keep you so far removed from us, it is
difficult not to bear them a grudge; and if they would reconcile
us quite, they have but to do two things more&mdash;to teach you
new tales that shall charm us like your old, and to spare you, at
least once in a while in summer, to climates within reach of us
who are task-bound for ten months in the year beside the
Thames.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Yours ever,</p>

ACROSS THE PLAINS</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">LEAVES FROM THE
NOTEBOOK OF AN EMIGRANT BETWEEN NEW YORK AND SAN
FRANCISCO</span></p>
<p><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;It was, if I remember rightly, five
o&rsquo;clock when we were all signalled to be present at the
Ferry Dep&ocirc;t of the railroad.&nbsp; An emigrant ship had
arrived at New York on the Saturday night, another on the Sunday
morning, our own on Sunday afternoon, a fourth early on Monday;
and as there is no emigrant train on Sunday a great part of the
passengers from these four ships was concentrated on the train by
which I was to travel.&nbsp; There was a babel of bewildered men,
women, and children.&nbsp; The wretched little booking-office,
and the baggage-room, which was not much larger, were crowded
thick with emigrants, and were heavy and rank with the atmosphere
of dripping clothes.&nbsp; Open carts full of bedding stood by
the half-hour in the rain.&nbsp; The officials loaded each other
with recriminations.&nbsp; A bearded, mildewed little man, whom I
take to have been an emigrant agent, was all over the place, his
mouth full of brimstone, blustering and interfering.&nbsp; It was
plain that the whole system, if system there was, had utterly
broken down under the strain of so many passengers.</p>
<p>My own ticket was given me at once, and an oldish man, who
preserved his head in the midst of this turmoil, got my baggage
registered, and counselled me to stay quietly where I was till he
should give me the word to move.&nbsp; I had taken along with me
a small valise, a knapsack, which I carried on my shoulders, and
in the bag of my railway rug the whole of <i>Bancroft&rsquo;s
History of the United States</i>, in six fat volumes.&nbsp; It
was as much as I could carry with convenience even for short
distances, but it insured me plenty of clothing, and the valise
was at that moment, and often after, useful for a stool.&nbsp; I
am sure I sat for an hour in the baggage-room, and wretched
enough it was; yet, when at last the word was passed to me and I
picked up my bundles and got under way, it was only to exchange
discomfort for downright misery and danger.</p>
<p>I followed the porters into a long shed reaching downhill from
West Street to the river.&nbsp; It was dark, the wind blew clean
through it from end to end; and here I found a great block of
passengers and baggage, hundreds of one and tons of the
other.&nbsp; I feel I shall have a difficulty to make myself
believed; and certainly the scene must have been exceptional, for
it was too dangerous for daily repetition.&nbsp; It was a tight
jam; there was no fair way through the mingled mass of brute and
living obstruction.&nbsp; Into the upper skirts of the crowd
porters, infuriated by hurry and overwork, clove their way with
shouts.&nbsp; I may say that we stood like sheep, and that the
porters charged among us like so many maddened sheep-dogs; and I
believe these men were no longer answerable for their acts.&nbsp;
It mattered not what they were carrying, they drove straight into
the press, and when they could get no farther, blindly discharged
their barrowful.&nbsp; With my own hand, for instance, I saved
the life of a child as it sat upon its mother&rsquo;s knee, she
sitting on a box; and since I heard of no accident, I must
suppose that there were many similar interpositions in the course
of the evening.&nbsp; It will give some idea of the state of mind
to which we were reduced if I tell you that neither the porter
nor the mother of the child paid the least attention to my
act.&nbsp; It was not till some time after that I understood what
I had done myself, for to ward off heavy boxes seemed at the
moment a natural incident of human life.&nbsp; Cold, wet,
clamour, dead opposition to progress, such as one encounters in
an evil dream, had utterly daunted the spirits.&nbsp; We had
accepted this purgatory as a child accepts the conditions of the
world.&nbsp; For my part, I shivered a little, and my back ached
wearily; but I believe I had neither a hope nor a fear, and all
the activities of my nature had become tributary to one massive
sensation of discomfort.</p>
<p>At length, and after how long an interval I hesitate to guess,
the crowd began to move, heavily straining through itself.&nbsp;
About the same time some lamps were lighted, and threw a sudden
flare over the shed.&nbsp; We were being filtered out into the
river boat for Jersey City.&nbsp; You may imagine how slowly this
filtering proceeded, through the dense, choking crush, every one
overladen with packages or children, and yet under the necessity
of fishing out his ticket by the way; but it ended at length for
me, and I found myself on deck under a flimsy awning and with a
trifle of elbow-room to stretch and breathe in.&nbsp; This was on
the starboard; for the bulk of the emigrants stuck hopelessly on
the port side, by which we had entered.&nbsp; In vain the seamen
shouted to them to move on, and threatened them with
shipwreck.&nbsp; These poor people were under a spell of stupor,
and did not stir a foot.&nbsp; It rained as heavily as ever, but
the wind now came in sudden claps and capfuls, not without danger
to a boat so badly ballasted as ours; and we crept over the river
in the darkness, trailing one paddle in the water like a wounded
duck, and passed ever and again by huge, illuminated steamers
running many knots, and heralding their approach by strains of
music.&nbsp; The contrast between these pleasure embarkations and
our own grim vessel, with her list to port and her freight of wet
and silent emigrants, was of that glaring description which we
count too obvious for the purposes of art.</p>
<p>The landing at Jersey City was done in a stampede.&nbsp; I had
a fixed sense of calamity, and to judge by conduct, the same
persuasion was common to us all.&nbsp; A panic selfishness, like
that produced by fear, presided over the disorder of our
landing.&nbsp; People pushed, and elbowed, and ran, their
families following how they could.&nbsp; Children fell, and were
picked up to be rewarded by a blow.&nbsp; One child, who had lost
her parents, screamed steadily and with increasing shrillness, as
though verging towards a fit; an official kept her by him, but no
one else seemed so much as to remark her distress; and I am
ashamed to say that I ran among the rest.&nbsp; I was so weary
that I had twice to make a halt and set down my bundles in the
hundred yards or so between the pier and the railway station, so
that I was quite wet by the time that I got under cover.&nbsp;
There was no waiting-room, no refreshment room; the cars were
locked; and for at least another hour, or so it seemed, we had to
camp upon the draughty, gaslit platform.&nbsp; I sat on my
valise, too crushed to observe my neighbours; but as they were
all cold, and wet, and weary, and driven stupidly crazy by the
mismanagement to which we had been subjected, I believe they can
have been no happier than myself.&nbsp; I bought half-a-dozen
oranges from a boy, for oranges and nuts were the only refection
to be had.&nbsp; As only two of them had even a pretence of
juice, I threw the other four under the cars, and beheld, as in a
dream, grown people and children groping on the track after my
leavings.</p>
<p>At last we were admitted into the cars, utterly dejected, and
far from dry.&nbsp; For my own part, I got out a clothes-brush,
and brushed my trousers as hard as I could till I had dried them
and warmed my blood into the bargain; but no one else, except my
next neighbour to whom I lent the brush, appeared to take the
least precaution.&nbsp; As they were, they composed themselves to
sleep.&nbsp; I had seen the lights of Philadelphia, and been
twice ordered to change carriages and twice countermanded, before
I allowed myself to follow their example.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;When I awoke, it was already day; the
train was standing idle; I was in the last carriage, and, seeing
some others strolling to and fro about the lines, I opened the
door and stepped forth, as from a caravan by the wayside.&nbsp;
We were near no station, nor even, as far as I could see, within
reach of any signal.&nbsp; A green, open, undulating country
stretched away upon all sides.&nbsp; Locust trees and a single
field of Indian corn gave it a foreign grace and interest; but
the contours of the land were soft and English.&nbsp; It was not
quite England, neither was it quite France; yet like enough
either to seem natural in my eyes.&nbsp; And it was in the sky,
and not upon the earth, that I was surprised to find a
change.&nbsp; Explain it how you may, and for my part I cannot
explain it at all, the sun rises with a different splendour in
America and Europe.&nbsp; There is more clear gold and scarlet in
our old country mornings; more purple, brown, and smoky orange in
those of the new.&nbsp; It may be from habit, but to me the
coming of day is less fresh and inspiriting in the latter; it has
a duskier glory, and more nearly resembles sunset; it seems to
fit some subsequential, evening epoch of the world, as though
America were in fact, and not merely in fancy, farther from the
orient of Aurora and the springs of day.&nbsp; I thought so then,
by the railroad side in Pennsylvania, and I have thought so a
dozen times since in far distant parts of the continent.&nbsp; If
it be an illusion it is one very deeply rooted, and in which my
eyesight is accomplice.</p>
<p>Soon after a train whisked by, announcing and accompanying its
passage by the swift beating of a sort of chapel bell upon the
engine; and as it was for this we had been waiting, we were
summoned by the cry of &ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; and went on
again upon our way.&nbsp; The whole line, it appeared, was
topsy-turvy; an accident at midnight having thrown all the
traffic hours into arrear.&nbsp; We paid for this in the flesh,
for we had no meals all that day.&nbsp; Fruit we could buy upon
the cars; and now and then we had a few minutes at some station
with a meagre show of rolls and sandwiches for sale; but we were
so many and so ravenous that, though I tried at every
opportunity, the coffee was always exhausted before I could elbow
my way to the counter.</p>
<p>Our American sunrise had ushered in a noble summer&rsquo;s
day.&nbsp; There was not a cloud; the sunshine was baking; yet in
the woody river valleys among which we wound our way, the
atmosphere preserved a sparkling freshness till late in the
afternoon.&nbsp; It had an inland sweetness and variety to one
newly from the sea; it smelt of woods, rivers, and the delved
earth.&nbsp; These, though in so far a country, were airs from
home.&nbsp; I stood on the platform by the hour; and as I saw,
one after another, pleasant villages, carts upon the highway and
fishers by the stream, and heard cockcrows and cheery voices in
the distance, and beheld the sun, no longer shining blankly on
the plains of ocean, but striking among shapely hills and his
light dispersed and coloured by a thousand accidents of form and
surface, I began to exult with myself upon this rise in life like
a man who had come into a rich estate.&nbsp; And when I had asked
the name of a river from the brakesman, and heard that it was
called the Susquehanna, the beauty of the name seemed to be part
and parcel of the beauty of the land.&nbsp; As when Adam with
divine fitness named the creatures, so this word Susquehanna was
at once accepted by the fancy.&nbsp; That was the name, as no
other could be, for that shining river and desirable valley.</p>
<p>None can care for literature in itself who do not take a
special pleasure in the sound of names; and there is no part of
the world where nomenclature is so rich, poetical, humorous, and
picturesque as the United States of America.&nbsp; All times,
races, and languages have brought their contribution.&nbsp; Pekin
is in the same State with Euclid, with Bellefontaine, and with
Sandusky.&nbsp; Chelsea, with its London associations of red
brick, Sloane Square, and the King&rsquo;s Road, is own suburb to
stately and primeval Memphis; there they have their seat,
translated names of cities, where the Mississippi runs by
Tennessee and Arkansas; <a name="citation8"></a><a
href="#footnote8" class="citation">[8]</a> and both, while I was
crossing the continent, lay, watched by armed men, in the horror
and isolation of a plague.&nbsp; Old, red Manhattan lies, like an
Indian arrowhead under a steam factory, below anglified New
York.&nbsp; The names of the States and Territories themselves
form a chorus of sweet and most romantic vocables: Delaware,
Ohio, Indiana, Florida, Dakota, Iowa, Wyoming, Minnesota, and the
Carolinas; there are few poems with a nobler music for the ear: a
songful, tuneful land; and if the new Homer shall arise from the
Western continent, his verse will be enriched, his pages sing
spontaneously, with the names of states and cities that would
strike the fancy in a business circular.</p>
<p>Late in the evening we were landed in a waiting-room at
Pittsburg.&nbsp; I had now under my charge a young and sprightly
Dutch widow with her children; these I was to watch over
providentially for a certain distance farther on the way; but as
I found she was furnished with a basket of eatables, I left her
in the waiting-room to seek a dinner for myself.&nbsp; I mention
this meal, not only because it was the first of which I had
partaken for about thirty hours, but because it was the means of
my first introduction to a coloured gentleman.&nbsp; He did me
the honour to wait upon me after a fashion, while I was eating;
and with every word, look, and gesture marched me farther into
the country of surprise.&nbsp; He was indeed strikingly unlike
the negroes of Mrs. Beecher Stowe, or the Christy Minstrels of my
youth.&nbsp; Imagine a gentleman, certainly somewhat dark, but of
a pleasant warm hue, speaking English with a slight and rather
odd foreign accent, every inch a man of the world, and armed with
manners so patronisingly superior that I am at a loss to name
their parallel in England.&nbsp; A butler perhaps rides as high
over the unbutlered, but then he sets you right with a reserve
and a sort of sighing patience which one is often moved to
admire.&nbsp; And again, the abstract butler never stoops to
familiarity.&nbsp; But the coloured gentleman will pass you a
wink at a time; he is familiar like an upper form boy to a fag;
he unbends to you like Prince Hal with Poins and Falstaff.&nbsp;
He makes himself at home and welcome.&nbsp; Indeed, I may say,
this waiter behaved himself to me throughout that supper much as,
with us, a young, free, and not very self-respecting master might
behave to a good-looking chambermaid.&nbsp; I had come prepared
to pity the poor negro, to put him at his ease, to prove in a
thousand condescensions that I was no sharer in the prejudice of
race; but I assure you I put my patronage away for another
occasion, and had the grace to be pleased with that result.</p>
<p>Seeing he was a very honest fellow, I consulted him upon a
point of etiquette: if one should offer to tip the American
waiter?&nbsp; Certainly not, he told me.&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; It
would not do.&nbsp; They considered themselves too highly to
accept.&nbsp; They would even resent the offer.&nbsp; As for him
and me, we had enjoyed a very pleasant conversation; he, in
particular, had found much pleasure in my society; I was a
stranger; this was exactly one of those rare
conjunctures....&nbsp; Without being very clear seeing, I can
still perceive the sun at noonday; and the coloured gentleman
deftly pocketed a quarter.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;A little after midnight I convoyed my
widow and orphans on board the train; and morning found us far
into Ohio.&nbsp; This had early been a favourite home of my
imagination; I have played at being in Ohio by the week, and
enjoyed some capital sport there with a dummy gun, my person
being still unbreeched.&nbsp; My preference was founded on a work
which appeared in <i>Cassell&rsquo;s Family Paper</i>, and was
read aloud to me by my nurse.&nbsp; It narrated the doings of one
Custaloga, an Indian brave, who, in the last chapter, very
obligingly washed the paint off his face and became Sir Reginald
Somebody-or-other; a trick I never forgave him.&nbsp; The idea of
a man being an Indian brave, and then giving that up to be a
baronet, was one which my mind rejected.&nbsp; It offended
verisimilitude, like the pretended anxiety of Robinson Crusoe and
others to escape from uninhabited islands.</p>
<p>But Ohio was not at all as I had pictured it.&nbsp; We were
now on those great plains which stretch unbroken to the Rocky
Mountains.&nbsp; The country was flat like Holland, but far from
being dull.&nbsp; All through Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa,
or for as much as I saw of them from the train and in my waking
moments, it was rich and various, and breathed an elegance
peculiar to itself.&nbsp; The tall corn pleased the eye; the
trees were graceful in themselves, and framed the plain into
long, a&euml;rial vistas; and the clean, bright, gardened
townships spoke of country fare and pleasant summer evenings on
the stoop.&nbsp; It was a sort of flat paradise; but, I am
afraid, not unfrequented by the devil.&nbsp; That morning dawned
with such a freezing chill as I have rarely felt; a chill that
was not perhaps so measurable by instrument, as it struck home
upon the heart and seemed to travel with the blood.&nbsp; Day
came in with a shudder.&nbsp; White mists lay thinly over the
surface of the plain, as we see them more often on a lake; and
though the sun had soon dispersed and drunk them up, leaving an
atmosphere of fever heat and crystal pureness from horizon to
horizon, the mists had still been there, and we knew that this
paradise was haunted by killing damps and foul malaria.&nbsp; The
fences along the line bore but two descriptions of advertisement;
one to recommend tobaccos, and the other to vaunt remedies
against the ague.&nbsp; At the point of day, and while we were
all in the grasp of that first chill, a native of the state, who
had got in at some way station, pronounced it, with a doctoral
air, &ldquo;a fever and ague morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dutch widow was a person of some character.&nbsp; She had
conceived at first sight a great aversion for the present writer,
which she was at no pains to conceal.&nbsp; But being a woman of
a practical spirit, she made no difficulty about accepting my
attentions, and encouraged me to buy her children fruits and
candies, to carry all her parcels, and even to sleep upon the
floor that she might profit by my empty seat.&nbsp; Nay, she was
such a rattle by nature, and, so powerfully moved to
autobiographical talk, that she was forced, for want of a better,
to take me into confidence and tell me the story of her
life.&nbsp; I heard about her late husband, who seemed to have
made his chief impression by taking her out pleasuring on
Sundays.&nbsp; I could tell you her prospects, her hopes, the
amount of her fortune, the cost of her housekeeping by the week,
and a variety of particular matters that are not usually
disclosed except to friends.&nbsp; At one station, she shook up
her children to look at a man on the platform and say if he were
not like Mr. Z.; while to me she explained how she had been
keeping company with this Mr. Z., how far matters had proceeded,
and how it was because of his desistance that she was now
travelling to the West.&nbsp; Then, when I was thus put in
possession of the facts, she asked my judgment on that type of
manly beauty.&nbsp; I admired it to her heart&rsquo;s
content.&nbsp; She was not, I think, remarkably veracious in
talk, but broidered as fancy prompted, and built castles in the
air out of her past; yet she had that sort of candour, to keep
me, in spite of all these confidences, steadily aware of her
aversion.&nbsp; Her parting words were ingeniously honest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;we all <i>ought</i> to
be very much obliged to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I cannot pretend that
she put me at my ease; but I had a certain respect for such a
genuine dislike.&nbsp; A poor nature would have slipped, in the
course of these familiarities, into a sort of worthless
toleration for me.</p>
<p>We reached Chicago in the evening.&nbsp; I was turned out of
the cars, bundled into an omnibus, and driven off through the
streets to the station of a different railroad.&nbsp; Chicago
seemed a great and gloomy city.&nbsp; I remember having
subscribed, let us say sixpence, towards its restoration at the
period of the fire; and now when I beheld street after street of
ponderous houses and crowds of comfortable burghers, I thought it
would be a graceful act for the corporation to refund that
sixpence, or, at the least, to entertain me to a cheerful
dinner.&nbsp; But there was no word of restitution.&nbsp; I was
that city&rsquo;s benefactor, yet I was received in a third-class
waiting-room, and the best dinner I could get was a dish of ham
and eggs at my own expense.</p>
<p>I can safely say, I have never been so dog-tired as that night
in Chicago.&nbsp; When it was time to start, I descended the
platform like a man in a dream.&nbsp; It was a long train,
lighted from end to end; and car after car, as I came up with it,
was not only filled but overflowing.&nbsp; My valise, my
knapsack, my rug, with those six ponderous tomes of Bancroft,
weighed me double; I was hot, feverish, painfully athirst; and
there was a great darkness over me, an internal darkness, not to
be dispelled by gas.&nbsp; When at last I found an empty bench, I
sank into it like a bundle of rags, the world seemed to swim away
into the distance, and my consciousness dwindled within me to a
mere pin&rsquo;s head, like a taper on a foggy night.</p>
<p>When I came a little more to myself, I found that there had
sat down beside me a very cheerful, rosy little German gentleman,
somewhat gone in drink, who was talking away to me, nineteen to
the dozen, as they say.&nbsp; I did my best to keep up the
conversation; for it seemed to me dimly as if something depended
upon that.&nbsp; I heard him relate, among many other things,
that there were pickpockets on the train, who had already robbed
a man of forty dollars and a return ticket; but though I caught
the words, I do not think I properly understood the sense until
next morning; and I believe I replied at the time that I was very
glad to hear it.&nbsp; What else he talked about I have no guess;
I remember a gabbling sound of words, his profuse gesticulation,
and his smile, which was highly explanatory: but no more.&nbsp;
And I suppose I must have shown my confusion very plainly; for,
first, I saw him knit his brows at me like one who has conceived
a doubt; next, he tried me in German, supposing perhaps that I
was unfamiliar with the English tongue; and finally, in despair,
he rose and left me.&nbsp; I felt chagrined; but my fatigue was
too crushing for delay, and, stretching myself as far as that was
possible upon the bench, I was received at once into a dreamless
stupor.</p>
<p>The little German gentleman was only going a little way into
the suburbs after a <i>diner fin</i>, and was bent on
entertainment while the journey lasted.&nbsp; Having failed with
me, he pitched next upon another emigrant, who had come through
from Canada, and was not one jot less weary than myself.&nbsp;
Nay, even in a natural state, as I found next morning when we
scraped acquaintance, he was a heavy, uncommunicative man.&nbsp;
After trying him on different topics, it appears that the little
German gentleman flounced into a temper, swore an oath or two,
and departed from that car in quest of livelier society.&nbsp;
Poor little gentleman!&nbsp; I suppose he thought an emigrant
should be a rollicking, free-hearted blade, with a flask of
foreign brandy and a long, comical story to beguile the moments
of digestion.</p>
<p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;I suppose there must be a cycle in the
fatigue of travelling, for when I awoke next morning, I was
entirely renewed in spirits and ate a hearty breakfast of
porridge, with sweet milk, and coffee and hot cakes, at
Burlington upon the Mississippi.&nbsp; Another long day&rsquo;s
ride followed, with but one feature worthy of remark.&nbsp; At a
place called Creston, a drunken man got in.&nbsp; He was
aggressively friendly, but, according to English notions, not at
all unpresentable upon a train.&nbsp; For one stage he eluded the
notice of the officials; but just as we were beginning to move
out of the next station, Cromwell by name, by came the
conductor.&nbsp; There was a word or two of talk; and then the
official had the man by the shoulders, twitched him from his
seat, marched him through the car, and sent him flying on to the
track.&nbsp; It was done in three motions, as exact as a piece of
drill.&nbsp; The train was still moving slowly, although
beginning to mend her pace, and the drunkard got his feet without
a fall.&nbsp; He carried a red bundle, though not so red as his
cheeks; and he shook this menacingly in the air with one hand,
while the other stole behind him to the region of the
kidneys.&nbsp; It was the first indication that I had come among
revolvers, and I observed it with some emotion.&nbsp; The
conductor stood on the steps with one hand on his hip, looking
back at him; and perhaps this attitude imposed upon the creature,
for he turned without further ado, and went off staggering along
the track towards Cromwell followed by a peal of laughter from
the cars.&nbsp; They were speaking English all about me, but I
knew I was in a foreign land.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes before nine that night, we were deposited at
the Pacific Transfer Station near Council Bluffs, on the eastern
bank of the Missouri river.&nbsp; Here we were to stay the night
at a kind of caravanserai, set apart for emigrants.&nbsp; But I
gave way to a thirst for luxury, separated myself from my
companions, and marched with my effects into the Union Pacific
Hotel.&nbsp; A white clerk and a coloured gentleman whom, in my
plain European way, I should call the boots, were installed
behind a counter like bank tellers.&nbsp; They took my name,
assigned me a number, and proceeded to deal with my
packages.&nbsp; And here came the tug of war.&nbsp; I wished to
give up my packages into safe keeping; but I did not wish to go
to bed.&nbsp; And this, it appeared, was impossible in an
American hotel.</p>
<p>It was, of course, some inane misunderstanding, and sprang
from my unfamiliarity with the language.&nbsp; For although two
nations use the same words and read the same books, intercourse
is not conducted by the dictionary.&nbsp; The business of life is
not carried on by words, but in set phrases, each with a special
and almost a slang signification.&nbsp; Some international
obscurity prevailed between me and the coloured gentleman at
Council Bluffs; so that what I was asking, which seemed very
natural to me, appeared to him a monstrous exigency.&nbsp; He
refused, and that with the plainness of the West.&nbsp; This
American manner of conducting matters of business is, at first,
highly unpalatable to the European.&nbsp; When we approach a man
in the way of his calling, and for those services by which he
earns his bread, we consider him for the time being our hired
servant.&nbsp; But in the American opinion, two gentlemen meet
and have a friendly talk with a view to exchanging favours if
they shall agree to please.&nbsp; I know not which is the more
convenient, nor even which is the more truly courteous.&nbsp; The
English stiffness unfortunately tends to be continued after the
particular transaction is at an end, and thus favours class
separations.&nbsp; But on the other hand, these equalitarian
plainnesses leave an open field for the insolence of
Jack-in-office.</p>
<p>I was nettled by the coloured gentleman&rsquo;s refusal, and
unbuttoned my wrath under the similitude of ironical
submission.&nbsp; I knew nothing, I said, of the ways of American
hotels; but I had no desire to give trouble.&nbsp; If there was
nothing for it but to get to bed immediately, let him say the
word, and though it was not my habit, I should cheerfully
obey.</p>
<p>He burst into a shout of laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;you do not know about America.&nbsp; They are
fine people in America.&nbsp; Oh! you will like them very
well.&nbsp; But you mustn&rsquo;t get mad.&nbsp; I know what you
want.&nbsp; You come along with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And issuing from behind the counter, and taking me by the arm
like an old acquaintance, he led me to the bar of the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, pushing me from him by the
shoulder, &ldquo;go and have a drink!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Emigrant Train</span></h3>
<p>All this while I had been travelling by mixed trains, where I
might meet with Dutch widows and little German gentry fresh from
table.&nbsp; I had been but a latent emigrant; now I was to be
branded once more, and put apart with my fellows.&nbsp; It was
about two in the afternoon of Friday that I found myself in front
of the Emigrant House, with more than a hundred others, to be
sorted and boxed for the journey.&nbsp; A white-haired official,
with a stick under one arm, and a list in the other hand, stood
apart in front of us, and called name after name in the tone of a
command.&nbsp; At each name you would see a family gather up its
brats and bundles and run for the hindmost of the three cars that
stood awaiting us, and I soon concluded that this was to be set
apart for the women and children.&nbsp; The second or central
car, it turned out, was devoted to men travelling alone, and the
third to the Chinese.&nbsp; The official was easily moved to
anger at the least delay; but the emigrants were both quick at
answering their names, and speedy in getting themselves and their
effects on board.</p>
<p>The families once housed, we men carried the second car
without ceremony by simultaneous assault.&nbsp; I suppose the
reader has some notion of an American railroad-car, that long,
narrow wooden box, like a flat-roofed Noah&rsquo;s ark, with a
stove and a convenience, one at either end, a passage down the
middle, and transverse benches upon either hand.&nbsp; Those
destined for emigrants on the Union Pacific are only remarkable
for their extreme plainness, nothing but wood entering in any
part into their constitution, and for the usual inefficacy of the
lamps, which often went out and shed but a dying glimmer even
while they burned.&nbsp; The benches are too short for anything
but a young child.&nbsp; Where there is scarce elbow-room for two
to sit, there will not be space enough for one to lie.&nbsp;
Hence the company, or rather, as it appears from certain bills
about the Transfer Station, the company&rsquo;s servants, have
conceived a plan for the better accommodation of
travellers.&nbsp; They prevail on every two to chum
together.&nbsp; To each of the chums they sell a board and three
square cushions stuffed with straw, and covered with thin
cotton.&nbsp; The benches can be made to face each other in
pairs, for the backs are reversible.&nbsp; On the approach of
night the boards are laid from bench to bench, making a couch
wide enough for two, and long enough for a man of the middle
height; and the chums lie down side by side upon the cushions
with the head to the conductor&rsquo;s van and the feet to the
engine.&nbsp; When the train is full, of course this plan is
impossible, for there must not be more than one to every bench,
neither can it be carried out unless the chums agree.&nbsp; It
was to bring about this last condition that our white-haired
official now bestirred himself.&nbsp; He made a most active
master of ceremonies, introducing likely couples, and even
guaranteeing the amiability and honesty of each.&nbsp; The
greater the number of happy couples the better for his pocket,
for it was he who sold the raw material of the beds.&nbsp; His
price for one board and three straw cushions began with two
dollars and a half; but before the train left, and, I am sorry to
say, long after I had purchased mine, it had fallen to one dollar
and a half.</p>
<p>The match-maker had a difficulty with me; perhaps, like some
ladies, I showed myself too eager for union at any price; but
certainly the first who was picked out to be my bedfellow,
declined the honour without thanks.&nbsp; He was an old, heavy,
slow-spoken man, I think from Yankeeland, looked me all over with
great timidity, and then began to excuse himself in broken
phrases.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t know the young man, he said.&nbsp;
The young man might be very honest, but how was he to know
that?&nbsp; There was another young man whom he had met already
in the train; he guessed he was honest, and would prefer to chum
with him upon the whole.&nbsp; All this without any sort of
excuse, as though I had been inanimate or absent.&nbsp; I began
to tremble lest every one should refuse my company, and I be left
rejected.&nbsp; But the next in turn was a tall, strapping,
long-limbed, small-headed, curly-haired Pennsylvania Dutchman,
with a soldierly smartness in his manner.&nbsp; To be exact, he
had acquired it in the navy.&nbsp; But that was all one; he had
at least been trained to desperate resolves, so he accepted the
match, and the white-haired swindler pronounced the connubial
benediction, and pocketed his fees.</p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon was spent in making up the
train.&nbsp; I am afraid to say how many baggage-waggons followed
the engine, certainly a score; then came the Chinese, then we,
then the families, and the rear was brought up by the conductor
in what, if I have it rightly, is called his caboose.&nbsp; The
class to which I belonged was of course far the largest, and we
ran over, so to speak, to both sides; so that there were some
Caucasians among the Chinamen, and some bachelors among the
families.&nbsp; But our own car was pure from admixture, save for
one little boy of eight or nine who had the whooping-cough.&nbsp;
At last, about six, the long train crawled out of the Transfer
Station and across the wide Missouri river to Omaha, westward
bound.</p>
<p>It was a troubled uncomfortable evening in the cars.&nbsp;
There was thunder in the air, which helped to keep us
restless.&nbsp; A man played many airs upon the cornet, and none
of them were much attended to, until he came to &ldquo;Home,
sweet home.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was truly strange to note how the
talk ceased at that, and the faces began to lengthen.&nbsp; I
have no idea whether musically this air is to be considered good
or bad; but it belongs to that class of art which may be best
described as a brutal assault upon the feelings.&nbsp; Pathos
must be relieved by dignity of treatment.&nbsp; If you wallow
naked in the pathetic, like the author of &ldquo;Home, sweet
home,&rdquo; you make your hearers weep in an unmanly fashion;
and even while yet they are moved, they despise themselves and
hate the occasion of their weakness.&nbsp; It did not come to
tears that night, for the experiment was interrupted.&nbsp; An
elderly, hard-looking man, with a goatee beard and about as much
appearance of sentiment an you would expect from a retired
slaver, turned with a start and bade the performer stop that
&ldquo;damned thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about
enough of that,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;give us something about
the good country we&rsquo;re going to.&rdquo;&nbsp; A murmur of
adhesion ran round the car; the performer took the instrument
from his lips, laughed and nodded, and then struck into a dancing
measure; and, like a new Timotheus, stilled immediately the
emotion he had raised.</p>
<p>The day faded; the lamps were lit; a party of wild young men,
who got off next evening at North Platte, stood together on the
stern platform, singing &ldquo;The Sweet By-and-bye&rdquo; with
very tuneful voices; the chums began to put up their beds; and it
seemed as if the business of the day were at an end.&nbsp; But it
was not so; for, the train stopping at some station, the cars
were instantly thronged with the natives, wives and fathers,
young men and maidens, some of them in little more than
nightgear, some with stable lanterns, and all offering beds for
sale.&nbsp; Their charge began with twenty-five cents a cushion,
but fell, before the train went on again, to fifteen, with the
bed-board gratis, or less than one-fifth of what I had paid for
mine at the Transfer.&nbsp; This is my contribution to the
economy of future emigrants.</p>
<p>A great personage on an American train is the newsboy.&nbsp;
He sells books (such books!), papers, fruit, lollipops, and
cigars; and on emigrant journeys, soap, towels, tin washing
dishes, tin coffee pitchers, coffee, tea, sugar, and tinned
eatables, mostly hash or beans and bacon.&nbsp; Early next
morning the newsboy went around the cars, and chumming on a more
extended principle became the order of the hour.&nbsp; It
requires but a copartnery of two to manage beds; but washing and
eating can be carried on most economically by a syndicate of
three.&nbsp; I myself entered a little after sunrise into
articles of agreement, and became one of the firm of
Pennsylvania, Shakespeare, and Dubuque.&nbsp; Shakespeare was my
own nickname on the cars; Pennsylvania that of my bedfellow; and
Dubuque, the name of a place in the State of Iowa, that of an
amiable young fellow going west to cure an asthma, and retarding
his recovery by incessantly chewing or smoking, and sometimes
chewing and smoking together.&nbsp; I have never seen tobacco so
sillily abused.&nbsp; Shakespeare bought a tin washing-dish,
Dubuque a towel, and Pennsylvania a brick of soap.&nbsp; The
partners used these instruments, one after another, according to
the order of their first awaking; and when the firm had finished
there was no want of borrowers.&nbsp; Each filled the tin dish at
the water filter opposite the stove, and retired with the whole
stock in trade to the platform of the car.&nbsp; There he knelt
down, supporting himself by a shoulder against the woodwork or
one elbow crooked about the railing, and made a shift to wash his
face and neck and hands; a cold, an insufficient, and, if the
train is moving rapidly, a somewhat dangerous toilet.</p>
<p>On a similar division of expense, the firm of Pennsylvania,
Shakespeare, and Dubuque supplied themselves with coffee, sugar,
and necessary vessels; and their operations are a type of what
went on through all the cars.&nbsp; Before the sun was up the
stove would be brightly burning; at the first station the natives
would come on board with milk and eggs and coffee cakes; and soon
from end to end the car would be filled with little parties
breakfasting upon the bed-boards.&nbsp; It was the pleasantest
hour of the day.</p>
<p>There were meals to be had, however, by the wayside: a
breakfast in the morning, a dinner somewhere between eleven and
two, and supper from five to eight or nine at night.&nbsp; We had
rarely less than twenty minutes for each; and if we had not spent
many another twenty minutes waiting for some express upon a side
track among miles of desert, we might have taken an hour to each
repast and arrived at San Francisco up to time.&nbsp; For haste
is not the foible of an emigrant train.&nbsp; It gets through on
sufferance, running the gauntlet among its more considerable
brethren; should there be a block, it is unhesitatingly
sacrificed; and they cannot, in consequence, predict the length
of the passage within a day or so.&nbsp; Civility is the main
comfort that you miss.&nbsp; Equality, though conceived very
largely in America, does not extend so low down as to an
emigrant.&nbsp; Thus in all other trains, a warning cry of
&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; recalls the passengers to take their
seats; but as soon as I was alone with emigrants, and from the
Transfer all the way to San Francisco, I found this ceremony was
pretermitted; the train stole from the station without note of
warning, and you had to keep an eye upon it even while you
ate.&nbsp; The annoyance is considerable, and the disrespect both
wanton and petty.</p>
<p>Many conductors, again, will hold no communication with an
emigrant.&nbsp; I asked a conductor one day at what time the
train would stop for dinner; as he made no answer I repeated the
question, with a like result; a third time I returned to the
charge, and then Jack-in-office looked me coolly in the face for
several seconds and turned ostentatiously away.&nbsp; I believe
he was half ashamed of his brutality; for when another person
made the same inquiry, although he still refused the information,
he condescended to answer, and even to justify his reticence in a
voice loud enough for me to hear.&nbsp; It was, he said, his
principle not to tell people where they were to dine; for one
answer led to many other questions, as what o&rsquo;clock it was?
or, how soon should we be there? and he could not afford to be
eternally worried.</p>
<p>As you are thus cut off from the superior authorities, a great
deal of your comfort depends on the character of the
newsboy.&nbsp; He has it in his power indefinitely to better and
brighten the emigrant&rsquo;s lot.&nbsp; The newsboy with whom we
started from the Transfer was a dark, bullying, contemptuous,
insolent scoundrel, who treated us like dogs.&nbsp; Indeed, in
his case, matters came nearly to a fight.&nbsp; It happened thus:
he was going his rounds through the cars with some commodities
for sale, and coming to a party who were at <i>Seven-up</i> or
<i>Cascino</i> (our two games), upon a bed-board, slung down a
cigar-box in the middle of the cards, knocking one man&rsquo;s
hand to the floor.&nbsp; It was the last straw.&nbsp; In a moment
the whole party were upon their feet, the cigars were upset, and
he was ordered to &ldquo;get out of that directly, or he would
get more than he reckoned for.&rdquo; The fellow grumbled and
muttered, but ended by making off, and was less openly insulting
in the future.&nbsp; On the other hand, the lad who rode with us
in this capacity from Ogden to Sacramento made himself the friend
of all, and helped us with information, attention, assistance,
and a kind countenance.&nbsp; He told us where and when we should
have our meals, and how long the train would stop; kept seats at
table for those who were delayed, and watched that we should
neither be left behind nor yet unnecessarily hurried.&nbsp; You,
who live at home at ease, can hardly realise the greatness of
this service, even had it stood alone.&nbsp; When I think of that
lad coming and going, train after train, with his bright face and
civil words, I see how easily a good man may become the
benefactor of his kind.&nbsp; Perhaps he is discontented with
himself, perhaps troubled with ambitions; why, if he but knew it,
he is a hero of the old Greek stamp; and while he thinks he is
only earning a profit of a few cents, and that perhaps
exorbitant, he is doing a man&rsquo;s work, and bettering the
world.</p>
<p>I must tell here an experience of mine with another
newsboy.&nbsp; I tell it because it gives so good an example of
that uncivil kindness of the American, which is perhaps their
most bewildering character to one newly landed.&nbsp; It was
immediately after I had left the emigrant train; and I am told I
looked like a man at death&rsquo;s door, so much had this long
journey shaken me.&nbsp; I sat at the end of a car, and the catch
being broken, and myself feverish and sick, I had to hold the
door open with my foot for the sake of air.&nbsp; In this
attitude my leg debarred the newsboy from his box of
merchandise.&nbsp; I made haste to let him pass when I observed
that he was coming; but I was busy with a book, and so once or
twice he came upon me unawares.&nbsp; On these occasions he most
rudely struck my foot aside; and though I myself apologised, as
if to show him the way, he answered me never a word.&nbsp; I
chafed furiously, and I fear the next time it would have come to
words.&nbsp; But suddenly I felt a touch upon my shoulder, and a
large juicy pear was put into my hand.&nbsp; It was the newsboy,
who had observed that I was looking ill, and so made me this
present out of a tender heart.&nbsp; For the rest of the journey
I was petted like a sick child; he lent me newspapers, thus
depriving himself of his legitimate profit on their sale, and
came repeatedly to sit by me and cheer me up.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Plains of Nebraska</span></h3>
<p>It had thundered on the Friday night, but the sun rose on
Saturday without a cloud.&nbsp; We were at sea&mdash;there is no
other adequate expression&mdash;on the plains of Nebraska.&nbsp;
I made my observatory on the top of a fruit-waggon, and sat by
the hour upon that perch to spy about me, and to spy in vain for
something new.&nbsp; It was a world almost without a feature; an
empty sky, an empty earth; front and back, the line of railway
stretched from horizon to horizon, like a cue across a
billiard-board; on either hand, the green plain ran till it
touched the skirts of heaven.&nbsp; Along the track innumerable
wild sunflowers, no bigger than a crown-piece, bloomed in a
continuous flower-bed; grazing beasts were seen upon the prairie
at all degrees of distance and diminution; and now and again we
might perceive a few dots beside the railroad which grew more and
more distinct as we drew nearer till they turned into wooden
cabins, and then dwindled and dwindled in our wake until they
melted into their surroundings, and we were once more alone upon
the billiard-board.&nbsp; The train toiled over this infinity
like a snail; and being the one thing moving, it was wonderful
what huge proportions it began to assume in our regard.&nbsp; It
seemed miles in length, and either end of it within but a step of
the horizon.&nbsp; Even my own body or my own head seemed a great
thing in that emptiness.&nbsp; I note the feeling the more
readily as it is the contrary of what I have read of in the
experience of others.&nbsp; Day and night, above the roar of the
train, our ears were kept busy with the incessant chirp of
grasshoppers&mdash;a noise like the winding up of countless
clocks and watches, which began after a while to seem proper to
that land.</p>
<p>To one hurrying through by steam there was a certain
exhilaration in this spacious vacancy, this greatness of the air,
this discovery of the whole arch of heaven, this straight,
unbroken, prison-line of the horizon.&nbsp; Yet one could not but
reflect upon the weariness of those who passed by there in old
days, at the foot&rsquo;s pace of oxen, painfully urging their
teams, and with no landmark but that unattainable evening sun for
which they steered, and which daily fled them by an equal
stride.&nbsp; They had nothing, it would seem, to overtake;
nothing by which to reckon their advance; no sight for repose or
for encouragement; but stage after stage, only the dead green
waste under foot, and the mocking, fugitive horizon.&nbsp; But
the eye, as I have been told, found differences even here; and at
the worst the emigrant came, by perseverance, to the end of his
toil.&nbsp; It is the settlers, after all, at whom we have a
right to marvel.&nbsp; Our consciousness, by which we live, is
itself but the creature of variety.&nbsp; Upon what food does it
subsist in such a land?&nbsp; What livelihood can repay a human
creature for a life spent in this huge sameness?&nbsp; He is cut
off from books, from news, from company, from all that can
relieve existence but the prosecution of his affairs.&nbsp; A sky
full of stars is the most varied spectacle that he can
hope.&nbsp; He may walk five miles and see nothing; ten, and it
is as though he had not moved; twenty, and still he is in the
midst of the same great level, and has approached no nearer to
the one object within view, the flat horizon which keeps pace
with his advance.&nbsp; We are full at home of the question of
agreeable wall-papers, and wise people are of opinion that the
temper may be quieted by sedative surroundings.&nbsp; But what is
to be said of the Nebraskan settler?&nbsp; His is a wall-paper
with a vengeance&mdash;one quarter of the universe laid bare in
all its gauntness.</p>
<p>His eye must embrace at every glance the whole seeming concave
of the visible world; it quails before so vast an outlook, it is
tortured by distance; yet there is no rest or shelter till the
man runs into his cabin, and can repose his sight upon things
near at hand.&nbsp; Hence, I am told, a sickness of the vision
peculiar to these empty plains.</p>
<p>Yet perhaps with sunflowers and cicad&aelig;, summer and
winter, cattle, wife and family, the settler may create a full
and various existence.&nbsp; One person at least I saw upon the
plains who seemed in every way superior to her lot.&nbsp; This
was a woman who boarded us at a way station, selling milk.&nbsp;
She was largely formed; her features were more than comely; she
had that great rarity&mdash;a fine complexion which became her;
and her eyes were kind, dark, and steady.&nbsp; She sold milk
with patriarchal grace.&nbsp; There was not a line in her
countenance, not a note in her soft and sleepy voice, but spoke
of an entire contentment with her life.&nbsp; It would have been
fatuous arrogance to pity such a woman.&nbsp; Yet the place where
she lived was to me almost ghastly.&nbsp; Less than a dozen
wooden houses, all of a shape and all nearly of a size, stood
planted along the railway lines.&nbsp; Each stood apart in its
own lot.&nbsp; Each opened direct off the billiard-board, as if
it were a billiard-board indeed, and these only models that had
been set down upon it ready made.&nbsp; Her own, into which I
looked, was clean but very empty, and showed nothing homelike but
the burning fire.&nbsp; This extreme newness, above all in so
naked and flat a country, gives a strong impression of
artificiality.&nbsp; With none of the litter and discoloration of
human life; with the paths unworn, and the houses still sweating
from the axe, such a settlement as this seems purely
scenic.&nbsp; The mind is loth to accept it for a piece of
reality; and it seems incredible that life can go on with so few
properties, or the great child, man, find entertainment in so
bare a playroom.</p>
<p>And truly it is as yet an incomplete society in some points;
or at least it contained, as I passed through, one person
incompletely civilised.&nbsp; At North Platte, where we supped
that evening, one man asked another to pass the milk-jug.&nbsp;
This other was well-dressed and of what we should call a
respectable appearance; a darkish man, high spoken, eating as
though he had some usage of society; but he turned upon the first
speaker with extraordinary vehemence of tone&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a waiter here!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only asked you to pass the milk,&rdquo; explained the
first.</p>
<p>Here is the retort verbatim&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass!&nbsp; Hell!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not paid for that
business; the waiter&rsquo;s paid for it.&nbsp; You should use
civility at table, and, by God, I&rsquo;ll show you
how!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other man very wisely made no answer, and the bully went
on with his supper as though nothing had occurred.&nbsp; It
pleases me to think that some day soon he will meet with one of
his own kidney; and that perhaps both may fall.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Desert of Wyoming</span></h3>
<p>To cross such a plain is to grow homesick for the
mountains.&nbsp; I longed for the Black Hills of Wyoming, which I
knew we were soon to enter, like an ice-bound whaler for the
spring.&nbsp; Alas! and it was a worse country than the
other.&nbsp; All Sunday and Monday we travelled through these sad
mountains, or over the main ridge of the Rockies, which is a fair
match to them for misery of aspect.&nbsp; Hour after hour it was
the same unhomely and unkindly world about our onward path;
tumbled boulders, cliffs that drearily imitate the shape of
monuments and fortifications&mdash;how drearily, how tamely, none
can tell who has not seen them; not a tree, not a patch of sward,
not one shapely or commanding mountain form; sage-brush, eternal
sage-brush; over all, the same weariful and gloomy colouring,
grays warming into brown, grays darkening towards black; and for
sole sign of life, here and there a few fleeing antelopes; here
and there, but at incredible intervals, a creek running in a
ca&ntilde;on.&nbsp; The plains have a grandeur of their own; but
here there is nothing but a contorted smallness.&nbsp; Except for
the air, which was light and stimulating, there was not one good
circumstance in that God-forsaken land.</p>
<p>I had been suffering in my health a good deal all the way; and
at last, whether I was exhausted by my complaint or poisoned in
some wayside eating-house, the evening we left Laramie, I fell
sick outright.&nbsp; That was a night which I shall not readily
forget.&nbsp; The lamps did not go out; each made a faint shining
in its own neighbourhood, and the shadows were confounded
together in the long, hollow box of the car.&nbsp; The sleepers
lay in uneasy attitudes; here two chums alongside, flat upon
their backs like dead folk; there a man sprawling on the floor,
with his face upon his arm; there another half seated with his
head and shoulders on the bench.&nbsp; The most passive were
continually and roughly shaken by the movement of the train;
others stirred, turned, or stretched out their arms like
children; it was surprising how many groaned and murmured in
their sleep; and as I passed to and fro, stepping across the
prostrate, and caught now a snore, now a gasp, now a half-formed
word, it gave me a measure of the worthlessness of rest in that
unresting vehicle.&nbsp; Although it was chill, I was obliged to
open my window, for the degradation of the air soon became
intolerable to one who was awake and using the full supply of
life.&nbsp; Outside, in a glimmering night, I saw the black,
amorphous hills shoot by unweariedly into our wake.&nbsp; They
that long for morning have never longed for it more earnestly
than I.</p>
<p>And yet when day came, it was to shine upon the same broken
and unsightly quarter of the world.&nbsp; Mile upon mile, and not
a tree, a bird, or a river.&nbsp; Only down the long, sterile
ca&ntilde;ons, the train shot hooting and awoke the resting
echo.&nbsp; That train was the one piece of life in all the
deadly land; it was the one actor, the one spectacle fit to be
observed in this paralysis of man and nature.&nbsp; And when I
think how the railroad has been pushed through this unwatered
wilderness and haunt of savage tribes, and now will bear an
emigrant for some &pound;12 from the Atlantic to the Golden
Gates; how at each stage of the construction, roaring, impromptu
cities, full of gold and lust and death, sprang up and then died
away again, and are now but wayside stations in the desert; how
in these uncouth places pig-tailed Chinese pirates worked side by
side with border ruffians and broken men from Europe, talking
together in a mixed dialect, mostly oaths, gambling, drinking,
quarrelling and murdering like wolves; how the plumed hereditary
lord of all America heard, in this last fastness, the scream of
the &ldquo;bad medicine waggon&rdquo; charioting his foes; and
then when I go on to remember that all this epical turmoil was
conducted by gentlemen in frock coats, and with a view to nothing
more extraordinary than a fortune and a subsequent visit to
Paris, it seems to me, I own, as if this railway were the one
typical achievement of the age in which we live, as if it brought
together into one plot all the ends of the world and all the
degrees of social rank, and offered to some great writer the
busiest, the most extended, and the most varied subject for an
enduring literary work.&nbsp; If it be romance, if it be
contrast, if it be heroism that we require, what was Troy town to
this?&nbsp; But, alas! it is not these things that are
necessary&mdash;it is only Homer.</p>
<p>Here also we are grateful to the train, as to some god who
conducts us swiftly through these shades and by so many hidden
perils.&nbsp; Thirst, hunger, the sleight and ferocity of Indians
are all no more feared, so lightly do we skim these horrible
lands; as the gull, who wings safely through the hurricane and
past the shark.&nbsp; Yet we should not be forgetful of these
hardships of the past; and to keep the balance true, since I have
complained of the trifling discomforts of my journey, perhaps
more than was enough, let me add an original document.&nbsp; It
was not written by Homer, but by a boy of eleven, long since
dead, and is dated only twenty years ago.&nbsp; I shall
punctuate, to make things clearer, but not change the
spelling.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>My dear Sister Mary</i>,&mdash;<i>I am
afraid you will go nearly crazy when you read my
letter</i>.&nbsp; <i>If Jerry</i>&rdquo; (<i>the writer&rsquo;s
eldest brother</i>) &ldquo;<i>has not written to you before
now</i>, <i>you will be surprised to heare that we are in
California</i>, <i>and that poor Thomas</i>&rdquo; (<i>another
brother</i>, <i>of fifteen</i>) &ldquo;<i>is dead</i>.&nbsp;
<i>We started from</i> &mdash; <i>in July</i>, <i>with plenly of
provisions and too yoke oxen</i>.&nbsp; <i>We went along very
well till we got within six or seven hundred miles of
California</i>, <i>when the Indians attacked us</i>.&nbsp; <i>We
found places where they had killed the emigrants</i>.&nbsp; <i>We
had one passenger with us</i>, <i>too guns</i>, <i>and one
revolver</i>; <i>so we ran all the lead We had into bullets</i>
(<i>and</i>) <i>hung the guns up in the wagon so that we could
get at them in a minit</i>.&nbsp; <i>It was about two
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon</i>; <i>droave the cattel a little
way</i>; <i>when a prairie chicken alited a little way from the
wagon</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Jerry took out one of the guns to shoot it</i>,
<i>and told Tom drive the oxen</i>.&nbsp; <i>Tom and I drove the
oxen</i>, <i>and Jerry and the passenger went on</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Then</i>, <i>after a little</i>, <i>I left Tom and caught up
with Jerry and the other man</i>.&nbsp; <i>Jerry stopped Tom to
come up</i>; <i>me and the man went on and sit down by a little
stream</i>.&nbsp; <i>In a few minutes</i>, <i>we heard some
noise</i>; <i>then three shots</i> (<i>they all struck poor
Tom</i>, <i>I suppose</i>); <i>then they gave the war hoop</i>,
<i>and as many as twenty of the redskins came down upon
us</i>.&nbsp; <i>The three that shot Tom was hid by the side of
the road in the bushes</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I thought the Tom and Jerry were shot</i>; <i>so I
told the other man that Tom and Jerry were dead</i>, <i>and that
we had better try to escape</i>, <i>if possible</i>.&nbsp; <i>I
had no shoes on</i>; <i>having a sore foot</i>, <i>I thought I
would not put them on</i>.&nbsp; <i>The man and me run down the
road</i>, <i>but We was soon stopped by an Indian on a
pony</i>.&nbsp; <i>We then turend the other way</i>, <i>and run
up the side of the Mountain</i>, <i>and hid behind some cedar
trees</i>, <i>and stayed there till dark</i>.&nbsp; <i>The
Indians hunted all over after us</i>, <i>and verry close to
us</i>, <i>so close that we could here there tomyhawks
Jingle</i>.&nbsp; <i>At dark the man and me started on</i>, <i>I
stubing my toes against sticks and stones</i>.&nbsp; <i>We
traveld on all night</i>; <i>and next morning</i>, <i>just as it
was getting gray</i>, <i>we saw something in the shape of a
man</i>.&nbsp; <i>It layed Down in the grass</i>.&nbsp; <i>We
went up to it</i>, <i>and it was Jerry</i>.&nbsp; <i>He thought
we ware Indians</i>.&nbsp; <i>You can imagine how glad he was to
see me</i>.&nbsp; <i>He thought we was all dead but him</i>,
<i>and we thought him and Tom was dead</i>.&nbsp; <i>He had the
gun that he took out of the wagon to shoot the prairie
Chicken</i>; <i>all he had was the load that was in it</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We traveld on till about eight o&rsquo;clock</i>,
<i>We caught up with one wagon with too men with it</i>.&nbsp;
<i>We had traveld with them before one day</i>; <i>we stopt and
they Drove on</i>; <i>we knew that they was ahead of us</i>,
<i>unless they had been killed to</i>.&nbsp; <i>My feet was so
sore when we caught up with them that I had to ride</i>; <i>I
could not step</i>.&nbsp; <i>We traveld on for too days</i>,
<i>when the men that owned the cattle said they would</i>
(<i>could</i>) <i>not drive them another inch</i>.&nbsp; <i>We
unyoked the oxen</i>; <i>we had about seventy pounds of
flour</i>; <i>we took it out and divided it into four
packs</i>.&nbsp; <i>Each of the men took about 18 pounds apiece
and a blanket</i>.&nbsp; <i>I carried a little bacon</i>,
<i>dried meat</i>, <i>and little quilt</i>; <i>I had in all about
twelve pounds</i>.&nbsp; <i>We had one pint of flour a day for
our alloyance</i>.&nbsp; <i>Sometimes we made soup of it</i>;
<i>sometimes we</i> (<i>made</i>) <i>pancakes</i>; <i>and
sometimes mixed it up with cold water and eat it that
way</i>.&nbsp; <i>We traveld twelve or fourteen days</i>.&nbsp;
<i>The time came at last when we should have to reach some place
or starve</i>.&nbsp; <i>We saw fresh horse and cattle
tracks</i>.&nbsp; <i>The morning come</i>, <i>we scraped all the
flour out of the sack</i>, <i>mixed it up</i>, <i>and baked it
into bread</i>, <i>and made some soup</i>, <i>and eat everything
we had</i>.&nbsp; <i>We traveld on all day without anything to
eat</i>, <i>and that evening we Caught up with a sheep train of
eight wagons</i>.&nbsp; <i>We traveld with them till we arrived

</blockquote>
<p>And so ends this artless narrative.&nbsp; The little man was
at school again, God bless him, while his brother lay scalped
upon the deserts.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Fellow-Passengers</span></h3>
<p>At Ogden we changed cars from the Union Pacific to the Central
Pacific line of railroad.&nbsp; The change was doubly welcome;
for, first, we had better cars on the new line; and, second,
those in which we had been cooped for more than ninety hours had
begun to stink abominably.&nbsp; Several yards away, as we
returned, let us say from dinner, our nostrils were assailed by
rancid air.&nbsp; I have stood on a platform while the whole
train was shunting; and as the dwelling-cars drew near, there
would come a whiff of pure menagerie, only a little sourer, as
from men instead of monkeys.&nbsp; I think we are human only in
virtue of open windows.&nbsp; Without fresh air, you only require
a bad heart, and a remarkable command of the Queen&rsquo;s
English, to become such another as Dean Swift; a kind of leering,
human goat, leaping and wagging your scut on mountains of
offence.&nbsp; I do my best to keep my head the other way, and
look for the human rather than the bestial in this Yahoo-like
business of the emigrant train.&nbsp; But one thing I must say,
the car of the Chinese was notably the least offensive.</p>
<p>The cars on the Central Pacific were nearly twice as high, and
so proportionally airier; they were freshly varnished, which gave
us all a sense of cleanliness an though we had bathed; the seats
drew out and joined in the centre, so that there was no more need
for bed boards; and there was an upper tier of berths which could
be closed by day and opened at night.</p>
<p>I had by this time some opportunity of seeing the people whom
I was among.&nbsp; They were in rather marked contrast to the
emigrants I had met on board ship while crossing the
Atlantic.&nbsp; They were mostly lumpish fellows, silent and
noisy, a common combination; somewhat sad, I should say, with an
extraordinary poor taste in humour, and little interest in their
fellow-creatures beyond that of a cheap and merely external
curiosity.&nbsp; If they heard a man&rsquo;s name and business,
they seemed to think they had the heart of that mystery; but they
were as eager to know that much as they were indifferent to the
rest.&nbsp; Some of them were on nettles till they learned your
name was Dickson and you a journeyman baker; but beyond that,
whether you were Catholic or Mormon, dull or clever, fierce or
friendly, was all one to them.&nbsp; Others who were not so
stupid, gossiped a little, and, I am bound to say,
unkindly.&nbsp; A favourite witticism was for some lout to raise
the alarm of&nbsp; &ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; while the rest of us
were dining, thus contributing his mite to the general
discomfort.&nbsp; Such a one was always much applauded for his
high spirits.&nbsp; When I was ill coming through Wyoming, I was
astonished&mdash;fresh from the eager humanity on board
ship&mdash;to meet with little but laughter.&nbsp; One of the
young men even amused himself by incommoding me, as was then very
easy; and that not from ill-nature, but mere clodlike incapacity
to think, for he expected me to join the laugh.&nbsp; I did so,
but it was phantom merriment.&nbsp; Later on, a man from Kansas
had three violent epileptic fits, and though, of course, there
were not wanting some to help him, it was rather superstitious
terror than sympathy that his case evoked among his
fellow-passengers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I hope he&rsquo;s not going
to die!&rdquo; cried a woman; &ldquo;it would be terrible to have
a dead body!&rdquo;&nbsp; And there was a very general movement
to leave the man behind at the next station.&nbsp; This, by good
fortune, the conductor negatived.</p>
<p>There was a good deal of story-telling in some quarters; in
others, little but silence.&nbsp; In this society, more than any
other that ever I was in, it was the narrator alone who seemed to
enjoy the narrative.&nbsp; It was rarely that any one listened
for the listening.&nbsp; If he lent an ear to another man&rsquo;s
story, it was because he was in immediate want of a hearer for
one of his own.&nbsp; Food and the progress of the train were the
subjects most generally treated; many joined to discuss these who
otherwise would hold their tongues.&nbsp; One small knot had no
better occupation than to worm out of me my name; and the more
they tried, the more obstinately fixed I grew to baffle
them.&nbsp; They assailed me with artful questions and insidious
offers of correspondence in the future; but I was perpetually on
my guard, and parried their assaults with inward laughter.&nbsp;
I am sure Dubuque would have given me ten dollars for the
secret.&nbsp; He owed me far more, had he understood life, for
thus preserving him a lively interest throughout the
journey.&nbsp; I met one of my fellow-passengers months after,
driving a street tramway car in San Francisco; and, as the joke
was now out of season, told him my name without subterfuge.&nbsp;
You never saw a man more chapfallen.&nbsp; But had my name been
Demogorgon, after so prolonged a mystery he had still been
disappointed.</p>
<p>There were no emigrants direct from Europe&mdash;save one
German family and a knot of Cornish miners who kept grimly by
themselves, one reading the New Testament all day long through
steel spectacles, the rest discussing privately the secrets of
their old-world, mysterious race.&nbsp; Lady Hester Stanhope
believed she could make something great of the Cornish; for my
part, I can make nothing of them at all.&nbsp; A division of
races, older and more original than that of Babel, keeps this
close, esoteric family apart from neighbouring Englishmen.&nbsp;
Not even a Red Indian seems more foreign in my eyes.&nbsp; This
is one of the lessons of travel&mdash;that some of the strangest
races dwell next door to you at home.</p>
<p>The rest were all American born, but they came from almost
every quarter of that Continent.&nbsp; All the States of the
North had sent out a fugitive to cross the plains with me.&nbsp;
From Virginia, from Pennsylvania, from New York, from far western
Iowa and Kansas, from Maime that borders on the Canadas, and from
the Canadas themselves&mdash;some one or two were fleeing in
quest of a better land and better wages.&nbsp; The talk in the
train, like the talk I heard on the steamer, ran upon hard times,
short commons, and hope that moves ever westward.&nbsp; I thought
of my shipful from Great Britain with a feeling of despair.&nbsp;
They had come 3000 miles, and yet not far enough.&nbsp; Hard
times bowed them out of the Clyde, and stood to welcome them at
Sandy Hook.&nbsp; Where were they to go?&nbsp; Pennsylvania,
Maine, Iowa, Kansas?&nbsp; These were not places for immigration,
but for emigration, it appeared; not one of them, but I knew a
man who had lifted up his heel and left it for an ungrateful
country.&nbsp; And it was still westward that they ran.&nbsp;
Hunger, you would have thought, came out of the east like the
sun, and the evening was made of edible gold.&nbsp; And,
meantime, in the car in front of me, were there not half a
hundred emigrants from the opposite quarter?&nbsp; Hungry Europe
and hungry China, each pouring from their gates in search of
provender, had here come face to face.&nbsp; The two waves had
met; east and west had alike failed; the whole round world had
been prospected and condemned; there was no El Dorado anywhere;
and till one could emigrate to the moon, it seemed as well to
stay patiently at home.&nbsp; Nor was there wanting another sign,
at once more picturesque and more disheartening; for, as we
continued to steam westward toward the land of gold, we were
continually passing other emigrant trains upon the journey east;
and these were as crowded as our own.&nbsp; Had all these return
voyagers made a fortune in the mines?&nbsp; Were they all bound
for Paris, and to be in Rome by Easter?&nbsp; It would seem not,
for, whenever we met them, the passengers ran on the platform and
cried to us through the windows, in a kind of wailing chorus, to
&ldquo;come back.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the plains of Nebraska, in the
mountains of Wyoming, it was still the same cry, and dismal to my
heart, &ldquo;Come back!&rdquo;&nbsp; That was what we heard by
the way &ldquo;about the good country we were going
to.&rdquo;&nbsp; And at that very hour the Sand-lot of San
Francisco was crowded with the unemployed, and the echo from the
other side of Market Street was repeating the rant of
demagogues.</p>
<p>If, in truth, it were only for the sake of wages that men
emigrate, how many thousands would regret the bargain!&nbsp; But
wages, indeed, are only one consideration out of many; for we are
a race of gipsies, and love change and travel for themselves.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Despised Races</span></h3>
<p>Of all stupid ill-feelings, the sentiment of my fellow
Caucasians towards our companions in the Chinese car was the most
stupid and the worst.&nbsp; They seemed never to have looked at
them, listened to them, or thought of them, but hated them <i>a
priori</i>.&nbsp; The Mongols were their enemies in that cruel
and treacherous battle-field of money.&nbsp; They could work
better and cheaper in half a hundred industries, and hence there
was no calumny too idle for the Caucasians to repeat, and even to
believe.&nbsp; They declared them hideous vermin, and affected a
kind of choking in the throat when they beheld them.&nbsp; Now,
as a matter of fact, the young Chinese man is so like a large
class of European women, that on raising my head and suddenly
catching sight of one at a considerable distance, I have for an
instant been deceived by the resemblance.&nbsp; I do not say it
is the most attractive class of our women, but for all that many
a man&rsquo;s wife is less pleasantly favoured.&nbsp; Again, my
emigrants declared that the Chinese were dirty.&nbsp; I cannot
say they were clean, for that was impossible upon the journey;
but in their efforts after cleanliness they put the rest of us to
shame.&nbsp; We all pigged and stewed in one infamy, wet our
hands and faces for half a minute daily on the platform, and were
unashamed.&nbsp; But the Chinese never lost an opportunity, and
you would see them washing their feet&mdash;an act not dreamed of
among ourselves&mdash;and going as far as decency permitted to
wash their whole bodies.&nbsp; I may remark by the way that the
dirtier people are in their persons the more delicate is their
sense of modesty.&nbsp; A clean man strips in a crowded
boathouse; but he who is unwashed slinks in and out of bed
without uncovering an inch of skin.&nbsp; Lastly, these very foul
and malodorous Caucasians entertained the surprising illusion
that it was the Chinese waggon, and that alone, which
stank.&nbsp; I have said already that it was the exceptions and
notably the freshest of the three.</p>
<p>These judgments are typical of the feeling in all Western
America.&nbsp; The Chinese are considered stupid, because they
are imperfectly acquainted with English.&nbsp; They are held to
be base, because their dexterity and frugality enable them to
underbid the lazy, luxurious Caucasian.&nbsp; They are said to be
thieves; I am sure they have no monopoly of that.&nbsp; They are
called cruel; the Anglo-Saxon and the cheerful Irishman may each
reflect before he bears the accusation.&nbsp; I am told, again,
that they are of the race of river pirates, and belong to the
most despised and dangerous class in the Celestial Empire.&nbsp;
But if this be so, what remarkable pirates have we here! and what
must be the virtues, the industry, the education, and the
intelligence of their superiors at home!</p>
<p>Awhile ago it was the Irish, now it is the Chinese that must
go.&nbsp; Such is the cry.&nbsp; It seems, after all, that no
country is bound to submit to immigration any more than to
invasion; each is war to the knife, and resistance to either but
legitimate defence.&nbsp; Yet we may regret the free tradition of
the republic, which loved to depict herself with open arms,
welcoming all unfortunates.&nbsp; And certainly, as a man who
believes that he loves freedom, I may be excused some bitterness
when I find her sacred name misused in the contention.&nbsp; It
was but the other day that I heard a vulgar fellow in the
Sand-lot, the popular tribune of San Francisco, roaring for arms
and butchery.&nbsp; &ldquo;At the call of Abraham Lincoln,&rdquo;
said the orator, &ldquo;ye rose in the name of freedom to set
free the negroes; can ye not rise and liberate yourselves from a
few dirty Mongolians?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For my own part, I could not look but with wonder and respect
on the Chinese.&nbsp; Their forefathers watched the stars before
mine had begun to keep pigs.&nbsp; Gun-powder and printing, which
the other day we imitated, and a school of manners which we never
had the delicacy so much as to desire to imitate, were theirs in
a long-past antiquity.&nbsp; They walk the earth with us, but it
seems they must be of different clay.&nbsp; They hear the clock
strike the same hour, yet surely of a different epoch.&nbsp; They
travel by steam conveyance, yet with such a baggage of old
Asiatic thoughts and superstitions as might check the locomotive
in its course.&nbsp; Whatever is thought within the circuit of
the Great Wall; what the wry-eyed, spectacled schoolmaster
teaches in the hamlets round Pekin; religions so old that our
language looks a halfing boy alongside; philosophy so wise that
our best philosophers find things therein to wonder at; all this
travelled alongside of me for thousands of miles over plain and
mountain.&nbsp; Heaven knows if we had one common thought or
fancy all that way, or whether our eyes, which yet were formed
upon the same design, beheld the same world out of the railway
windows.&nbsp; And when either of us turned his thoughts to home
and childhood, what a strange dissimilarity must there not have
been in these pictures of the mind&mdash;when I beheld that old,
gray, castled city, high throned above the firth, with the flag
of Britain flying, and the red-coat sentry pacing over all; and
the man in the next car to me would conjure up some junks and a
pagoda and a fort of porcelain, and call it, with the same
affection, home.</p>
<p>Another race shared among my fellow-passengers in the
disfavour of the Chinese; and that, it is hardly necessary to
say, was the noble red man of old story&mdash;over whose own
hereditary continent we had been steaming all these days.&nbsp; I
saw no wild or independent Indian; indeed, I hear that such avoid
the neighbourhood of the train; but now and again at way
stations, a husband and wife and a few children, disgracefully
dressed out with the sweepings of civilisation, came forth and
stared upon the emigrants.&nbsp; The silent stoicism of their
conduct, and the pathetic degradation of their appearance, would
have touched any thinking creature, but my fellow-passengers
danced and jested round them with a truly Cockney baseness.&nbsp;
I was ashamed for the thing we call civilisation.&nbsp; We should
carry upon our consciences so much, at least, of our
forefathers&rsquo; misconduct as we continue to profit by
ourselves.</p>
<p>If oppression drives a wise man mad, what should be raging in
the hearts of these poor tribes, who have been driven back and
back, step after step, their promised reservations torn from them
one after another as the States extended westward, until at
length they are shut up into these hideous mountain deserts of
the centre&mdash;and even there find themselves invaded,
insulted, and hunted out by ruffianly diggers?&nbsp; The eviction
of the Cherokees (to name but an instance), the extortion of
Indian agents, the outrages of the wicked, the ill-faith of all,
nay, down to the ridicule of such poor beings as were here with
me upon the train, make up a chapter of injustice and indignity
such as a man must be in some ways base if his heart will suffer
him to pardon or forget.&nbsp; These old, well-founded,
historical hatreds have a savour of nobility for the
independent.&nbsp; That the Jew should not love the Christian,
nor the Irishman love the English, nor the Indian brave tolerate
the thought of the American, is not disgraceful to the nature of
man; rather, indeed, honourable, since it depends on wrongs
ancient like the race, and not personal to him who cherishes the
indignation.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">To the Golden Gates</span></h3>
<p>A little corner of Utah is soon traversed, and leaves no
particular impressions on the mind.&nbsp; By an early hour on
Wednesday morning we stopped to breakfast at Toano, a little
station on a bleak, high-lying plateau in Nevada.&nbsp; The man
who kept the station eating-house was a Scot, and learning that I
was the same, he grew very friendly, and gave me some advice on
the country I was now entering.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I tell you this, because I come from your
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hail, brither Scots!</p>
<p>His most important hint was on the moneys of this part of the
world.&nbsp; There is something in the simplicity of a decimal
coinage which is revolting to the human mind; thus the French, in
small affairs, reckon strictly by halfpence; and you have to
solve, by a spasm of mental arithmetic, such posers as
thirty-two, forty-five, or even a hundred halfpence.&nbsp; In the
Pacific States they have made a bolder push for complexity, and
settle their affairs by a coin that no longer that no longer
exists&mdash;the <i>bit</i>, or old Mexican real.&nbsp; The
supposed value of the bit is twelve and a half cents, eight to
the dollar.&nbsp; When it comes to two bits, the quarter-dollar
stands for the required amount.&nbsp; But how about an odd
bit?&nbsp; The nearest coin to it is a dime, which is, short by a
fifth.&nbsp; That, then, is called a <i>short</i> bit.&nbsp; If
you have one, you lay it triumphantly down, and save two and a
half cents.&nbsp; But if you have not, and lay down a quarter,
the bar-keeper or shopman calmly tenders you a dime by way of
change; and thus you have paid what is called a <i>long bit</i>,
and lost two and a half cents, or even, by comparison with a
short bit, five cents.&nbsp; In country places all over the
Pacific coast, nothing lower than a bit is ever asked or taken,
which vastly increases the cost of life; as even for a glass of
beer you must pay fivepence or sevenpence-halfpenny, as the case
may be.&nbsp; You would say that this system of mutual robbery
was as broad as it was long; but I have discovered a plan to make
it broader, with which I here endow the public.&nbsp; It is brief
and simple&mdash;radiantly simple.&nbsp; There is one place where
five cents are recognised, and that is the post-office.&nbsp; A
quarter is only worth two bits, a short and a long.&nbsp;
Whenever you have a quarter, go to the post-office and buy five
cents worth of postage-stamps; you will receive in change two
dimes, that is, two short bits.&nbsp; The purchasing power of
your money is undiminished.&nbsp; You can go and have your two
glasses of beer all the same; and you have made yourself a
present of five cents worth of postage-stamps into the
bargain.&nbsp; Benjamin Franklin would have patted me on the head
for this discovery.</p>
<p>From Toano we travelled all day through deserts of alkali and
sand, horrible to man, and bare sage-brush country that seemed
little kindlier, and came by supper-time to Elko.&nbsp; As we
were standing, after our manner, outside the station, I saw two
men whip suddenly from underneath the cars, and take to their
heels across country.&nbsp; They were tramps, it appeared, who
had been riding on the beams since eleven of the night before;
and several of my fellow-passengers had already seen and
conversed with them while we broke our fast at Toano.&nbsp; These
land stowaways play a great part over here in America, and I
should have liked dearly to become acquainted with them.</p>
<p>At Elko an odd circumstance befell me.&nbsp; I was coming out
from supper, when I was stopped by a small, stout, ruddy man,
followed by two others taller and ruddier than himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but do you
happen to be going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said I was, whereupon he said he hoped to persuade me to
desist from that intention.&nbsp; He had a situation to offer me,
and if we could come to terms, why, good and well.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m running a
theatre here, and we&rsquo;re a little short in the
orchestra.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a musician, I guess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assured him that, beyond a rudimentary acquaintance with
&ldquo;Auld Lang Syne&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Wearing of the
Green,&rdquo; I had no pretension whatever to that style.&nbsp;
He seemed much put out of countenance; and one of his taller
companions asked him, on the nail, for five dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, sir,&rdquo; added the latter to me, &ldquo;he
bet you were a musician; I bet you weren&rsquo;t.&nbsp; No
offence, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; I said, and the two withdrew to
the bar, where I presume the debt was liquidated.</p>
<p>This little adventure woke bright hopes in my
fellow-travellers, who thought they had now come to a country
where situations went a-begging.&nbsp; But I am not so sure that
the offer was in good faith.&nbsp; Indeed, I am more than half
persuaded it was but a feeler to decide the bet.</p>
<p>Of all the next day I will tell you nothing, for the best of
all reasons, that I remember no more than that we continued
through desolate and desert scenes, fiery hot and deadly
weary.&nbsp; But some time after I had fallen asleep that night,
I was awakened by one of my companions.&nbsp; It was in vain that
I resisted.&nbsp; A fire of enthusiasm and whisky burned in his
eyes; and he declared we were in a new country, and I must come
forth upon the platform and see with my own eyes.&nbsp; The train
was then, in its patient way, standing halted in a
by-track.&nbsp; It was a clear, moonlit night; but the valley was
too narrow to admit the moonshine direct, and only a diffused
glimmer whitened the tall rocks and relieved the blackness of the
pines.&nbsp; A hoarse clamour filled the air; it was the
continuous plunge of a cascade somewhere near at hand among the
mountains.&nbsp; The air struck chill, but tasted good and
vigorous in the nostrils&mdash;a fine, dry, old mountain
atmosphere.&nbsp; I was dead sleepy, but I returned to roost with
a grateful mountain feeling at my heart.</p>
<p>When I awoke next morning, I was puzzled for a while to know
if it were day or night, for the illumination was unusual.&nbsp;
I sat up at last, and found we were grading slowly downward
through a long snowshed; and suddenly we shot into an open; and
before we were swallowed into the next length of wooden tunnel, I
had one glimpse of a huge pine-forested ravine upon my left, a
foaming river, and a sky already coloured with the fires of
dawn.&nbsp; I am usually very calm over the displays of nature;
but you will scarce believe how my heart leaped at this.&nbsp; It
was like meeting one&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; I had come home
again&mdash;home from unsightly deserts to the green and
habitable corners of the earth.&nbsp; Every spire of pine along
the hill-top, every trouty pool along that mountain river, was
more dear to me than a blood relation.&nbsp; Few people have
praised God more happily than I did.&nbsp; And thenceforward,
down by Blue Ca&ntilde;on, Alta, Dutch Flat, and all the old
mining camps, through a sea of mountain forests, dropping
thousands of feet toward the far sea-level as we went, not I
only, but all the passengers on board, threw off their sense of
dirt and heat and weariness, and bawled like schoolboys, and
thronged with shining eyes upon the platform and became new
creatures within and without.&nbsp; The sun no longer oppressed
us with heat, it only shone laughingly along the mountain-side,
until we were fain to laugh ourselves for glee.&nbsp; At every
turn we could see farther into the land and our own happy
futures.&nbsp; At every town the cocks were tossing their clear
notes into the golden air, and crowing for the new day and the
new country.&nbsp; For this was indeed our destination; this was
&ldquo;the good country&rdquo; we had been going to so long.</p>
<p>By afternoon we were at Sacramento, the city of gardens in a
plain of corn; and the next day before the dawn we were lying to
upon the Oakland side of San Francisco Bay.&nbsp; The day was
breaking as we crossed the ferry; the fog was rising over the
citied hills of San Francisco; the bay was perfect&mdash;not a
ripple, scarce a stain, upon its blue expanse; everything was
waiting, breathless, for the sun.&nbsp; A spot of cloudy gold lit
first upon the head of Tamalpais, and then widened downward on
its shapely shoulder; the air seemed to awaken, and began to
sparkle; and suddenly</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The tall hills Titan discovered,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the city of San Francisco, and the bay of gold and corn,
were lit from end to end with summer daylight.</p>

THE OLD PACIFIC CAPITAL</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Woods and the Pacific</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Bay of Monterey has been
compared by no less a person than General Sherman to a bent
fishing-hook; and the comparison, if less important than the
march through Georgia, still shows the eye of a soldier for
topography.&nbsp; Santa Cruz sits exposed at the shank; the mouth
of the Salinas river is at the middle of the bend; and Monterey
itself is cosily ensconced beside the barb.&nbsp; Thus the
ancient capital of California faces across the bay, while the
Pacific Ocean, though hidden by low hills and forest, bombards
her left flank and rear with never-dying surf.&nbsp; In front of
the town, the long line of sea-beach trends north and north-west,
and then westward to enclose the bay.&nbsp; The waves which lap
so quietly about the jetties of Monterey grow louder and larger
in the distance; you can see the breakers leaping high and white
by day; at night, the outline of the shore is traced in
transparent silver by the moonlight and the flying foam; and from
all round, even in quiet weather, the distant, thrilling roar of
the Pacific hangs over the coast and the adjacent country like
smoke above a battle.</p>
<p>These long beaches are enticing to the idle man.&nbsp; It
would be hard to find a walk more solitary and at the same time
more exciting to the mind.&nbsp; Crowds of ducks and sea-gulls
hover over the sea.&nbsp; Sandpipers trot in and out by troops
after the retiring waves, trilling together in a chorus of
infinitesimal song.&nbsp; Strange sea-tangles, new to the
European eye, the bones of whales, or sometimes a whole
whale&rsquo;s carcase, white with carrion-gulls and poisoning the
wind, lie scattered here and there along the sands.&nbsp; The
waves come in slowly, vast and green, curve their translucent
necks, and burst with a surprising uproar, that runs, waxing and
waning, up and down the long key-board of the beach.&nbsp; The
foam of these great ruins mounts in an instant to the ridge of
the sand glacis, swiftly fleets back again, and is met and buried
by the next breaker.&nbsp; The interest is perpetually
fresh.&nbsp; On no other coast that I know shall you enjoy, in
calm, sunny weather, such a spectacle of Ocean&rsquo;s greatness,
such beauty of changing colour, or such degrees of thunder in the
sound.&nbsp; The very air is more than usually salt by this
Homeric deep.</p>
<p>Inshore, a tract of sand-hills borders on the beach.&nbsp;
Here and there a lagoon, more or less brackish, attracts the
birds and hunters.&nbsp; A rough, undergrowth partially conceals
the sand.&nbsp; The crouching, hardy live-oaks flourish singly or
in thickets&mdash;the kind of wood for murderers to crawl
among&mdash;and here and there the skirts of the forest extend
downward from the hills with a floor of turf and long aisles of
pine-trees hung with Spaniard&rsquo;s Beard.&nbsp; Through this
quaint desert the railway cars drew near to Monterey from the
junction at Salinas City&mdash;though that and so many other
things are now for ever altered&mdash;and it was from here that
you had the first view of the old township lying in the sands,
its white windmills bickering in the chill, perpetual wind, and
the first fogs of the evening drawing drearily around it from the
sea.</p>
<p>The one common note of all this country is the haunting
presence of the ocean.&nbsp; A great faint sound of breakers
follows you high up into the inland ca&ntilde;ons; the roar of
water dwells in the clean, empty rooms of Monterey as in a shell
upon the chimney; go where you will, you have but to pause and
listen to hear the voice of the Pacific.&nbsp; You pass out of
the town to the south-west, and mount the hill among
pine-woods.&nbsp; Glade, thicket, and grove surround you.&nbsp;
You follow winding sandy tracks that lead nowhither.&nbsp; You
see a deer; a multitude of quail arises.&nbsp; But the sound of
the sea still follows you as you advance, like that of wind among
the trees, only harsher and stranger to the ear; and when at
length you gain the summit, out breaks on every hand and with
freshened vigour that same unending, distant, whispering rumble
of the ocean; for now you are on the top of Monterey peninsula,
and the noise no longer only mounts to you from behind along the
beach towards Santa Cruz, but from your right also, round by
Chinatown and Pinos lighthouse, and from down before you to the
mouth of the Carmello river.&nbsp; The whole woodland is begirt
with thundering surges.&nbsp; The silence that immediately
surrounds you where you stand is not so much broken as it is
haunted by this distant, circling rumour.&nbsp; It sets your
senses upon edge; you strain your attention; you are clearly and
unusually conscious of small sounds near at hand; you walk
listening like an Indian hunter; and that voice of the Pacific is
a sort of disquieting company to you in your walk.</p>
<p>When once I was in these woods I found it difficult to turn
homeward.&nbsp; All woods lure a rambler onward; but in those of
Monterey it was the surf that particularly invited me to prolong
my walks.&nbsp; I would push straight for the shore where I
thought it to be nearest.&nbsp; Indeed, there was scarce a
direction that would not, sooner or later, have brought me forth
on the Pacific.&nbsp; The emptiness of the woods gave me a sense
of freedom and discovery in these excursions.&nbsp; I never in
all my visits met but one man.&nbsp; He was a Mexican, very dark
of hue, but smiling and fat, and he carried an axe, though his
true business at that moment was to seek for straying
cattle.&nbsp; I asked him what o&rsquo;clock it was, but he
seemed neither to know nor care; and when he in his turn asked me
for news of his cattle, I showed myself equally
indifferent.&nbsp; We stood and smiled upon each other for a few
seconds, and then turned without a word and took our several ways
across the forest.</p>
<p>One day&mdash;I shall never forget it&mdash;I had taken a
trail that was new to me.&nbsp; After a while the woods began to
open, the sea to sound nearer hand.&nbsp; I came upon a road,
and, to my surprise, a stile.&nbsp; A step or two farther, and,
without leaving the woods, I found myself among trim
houses.&nbsp; I walked through street after street, parallel and
at right angles, paved with sward and dotted with trees, but
still undeniable streets, and each with its name posted at the
corner, as in a real town.&nbsp; Facing down the main
thoroughfare&mdash;&ldquo;Central Avenue,&rdquo; as it was
ticketed&mdash;I saw an open-air temple, with benches and
sounding-board, as though for an orchestra.&nbsp; The houses were
all tightly shuttered; there was no smoke, no sound but of the
waves, no moving thing.&nbsp; I have never been in any place that
seemed so dreamlike.&nbsp; Pompeii is all in a bustle with
visitors, and its antiquity and strangeness deceive the
imagination; but this town had plainly not been built above a
year or two, and perhaps had been deserted overnight.&nbsp;
Indeed, it was not so much like a deserted town as like a scene
upon the stage by daylight, and with no one on the boards.&nbsp;
The barking of a dog led me at last to the only house still
occupied, where a Scotch pastor and his wife pass the winter
alone in this empty theatre.&nbsp; The place was &ldquo;The
Pacific Camp Grounds, the Christian Seaside Resort.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thither, in the warm season, crowds come to enjoy a life of
teetotalism, religion, and flirtation, which I am willing to
think blameless and agreeable.&nbsp; The neighbourhood at least
is well selected.&nbsp; The Pacific booms in front.&nbsp;
Westward is Point Pinos, with the lighthouse in a wilderness of
sand, where you will find the lightkeeper playing the piano,
making models and bows and arrows, studying dawn and sunrise in
amateur oil-painting, and with a dozen other elegant pursuits and
interests to surprise his brave, old-country rivals.&nbsp; To the
east, and still nearer, you will come upon a space of open down,
a hamlet, a haven among rocks, a world of surge and screaming
sea-gulls.&nbsp; Such scenes are very similar in different
climates; they appear homely to the eyes of all; to me this was
like a dozen spots in Scotland.&nbsp; And yet the boats that ride
in the haven are of strange outlandish design; and, if you walk
into the hamlet, you will behold costumes and faces and hear a
tongue that are unfamiliar to the memory.&nbsp; The joss-stick
burns, the opium pipe is smoked, the floors are strewn with slips
of coloured paper&mdash;prayers, you would say, that had somehow
missed their destination&mdash;and a man guiding his upright
pencil from right to left across the sheet, writes home the news
of Monterey to the Celestial Empire.</p>
<p>The woods and the Pacific rule between them the climate of
this seaboard region.&nbsp; On the streets of Monterey, when the
air does not smell salt from the one, it will be blowing perfumed
from the resinous tree-tops of the other.&nbsp; For days together
a hot, dry air will overhang the town, close as from an oven, yet
healthful and aromatic in the nostrils.&nbsp; The cause is not
far to seek, for the woods are afire, and the hot wind is blowing
from the hills.&nbsp; These fires are one of the great dangers of
California.&nbsp; I have seen from Monterey as many as three at
the same time, by day a cloud of smoke, by night a red coal of
conflagration in the distance.&nbsp; A little thing will start
them, and, if the wind be favourable, they gallop over miles of
country faster than a horse.&nbsp; The inhabitants must turn out
and work like demons, for it is not only the pleasant groves that
are destroyed; the climate and the soil are equally at stake, and
these fires prevent the rains of the next winter and dry up
perennial fountains.&nbsp; California has been a land of promise
in its time, like Palestine; but if the woods continue so swiftly
to perish, it may become, like Palestine, a land of
desolation.</p>
<p>To visit the woods while they are languidly burning is a
strange piece of experience.&nbsp; The fire passes through the
underbrush at a run.&nbsp; Every here and there a tree flares up
instantaneously from root to summit, scattering tufts of flame,
and is quenched, it seems, as quickly.&nbsp; But this last is
only in semblance.&nbsp; For after this first squib-like
conflagration of the dry moss and twigs, there remains behind a
deep-rooted and consuming fire in the very entrails of the
tree.&nbsp; The resin of the pitch-pine is principally condensed
at the base of the bole and in the spreading roots.&nbsp; Thus,
after the light, showy, skirmishing flames, which are only as the
match to the explosion, have already scampered down the wind into
the distance, the true harm is but beginning for this giant of
the woods.&nbsp; You may approach the tree from one side, and see
it scorched indeed from top to bottom, but apparently survivor of
the peril.&nbsp; Make the circuit, and there, on the other side
of the column, is a clear mass of living coal, spreading like an
ulcer; while underground, to their most extended fibre, the roots
are being eaten out by fire, and the smoke is rising through the
fissures to the surface.&nbsp; A little while, and, without a nod
of warning, the huge pine-tree snaps off short across the ground
and falls prostrate with a crash.&nbsp; Meanwhile the fire
continues its silent business; the roots are reduced to a fine
ash; and long afterwards, if you pass by, you will find the earth
pierced with radiating galleries, and preserving the design of
all these subterranean spurs, as though it were the mould for a
new tree instead of the print of an old one.&nbsp; These
pitch-pines of Monterey are, with the single exception of the
Monterey cypress, the most fantastic of forest trees.&nbsp; No
words can give an idea of the contortion of their growth; they
might figure without change in a circle of the nether hell as
Dante pictured it; and at the rate at which trees grow, and at
which forest fires spring up and gallop through the hills of
California, we may look forward to a time when there will not be
one of them left standing in that land of their nativity.&nbsp;
At least they have not so much to fear from the axe, but perish
by what may be called a natural although a violent death; while
it is man in his short-sighted greed that robs the country of the
nobler redwood.&nbsp; Yet a little while and perhaps all the
hills of seaboard California may be as bald as Tamalpais.</p>
<p>I have an interest of my own in these forest fires, for I came
so near to lynching on one occasion, that a braver man might have
retained a thrill from the experience.&nbsp; I wished to be
certain whether it was the moss, that quaint funereal ornament of
Californian forests, which blazed up so rapidly when the flame
first touched the tree.&nbsp; I suppose I must have been under
the influence of Satan, for instead of plucking off a piece for
my experiment what should I do but walk up to a great pine-tree
in a portion of the wood which had escaped so much as scorching,
strike a match, and apply the flame gingerly to one of the
tassels.&nbsp; The tree went off simply like a rocket; in three
seconds it was a roaring pillar of fire.&nbsp; Close by I could
hear the shouts of those who were at work combating the original
conflagration.&nbsp; I could see the waggon that had brought them
tied to a live oak in a piece of open; I could even catch the
flash of an axe as it swung up through the underwood into the
sunlight.&nbsp; Had any one observed the result of my experiment
my neck was literally not worth a pinch of snuff; after a few
minutes of passionate expostulation I should have been run up to
convenient bough.</p>
<blockquote><p>To die for faction is a common evil;<br />
But to be hanged for nonsense is the devil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have run repeatedly, but never as I ran that day.&nbsp; At
night I went out of town, and there was my own particular fire,
quite distinct from the other, and burning as I thought with even
greater vigour.</p>
<p>But it is the Pacific that exercises the most direct and
obvious power upon the climate.&nbsp; At sunset, for months
together, vast, wet, melancholy fogs arise and come shoreward
from the ocean.&nbsp; From the hill-top above Monterey the scene
is often noble, although it is always sad.&nbsp; The upper air is
still bright with sunlight; a glow still rests upon the Gabelano
Peak; but the fogs are in possession of the lower levels; they
crawl in scarves among the sandhills; they float, a little
higher, in clouds of a gigantic size and often of a wild
configuration; to the south, where they have struck the seaward
shoulder of the mountains of Santa Lucia, they double back and
spire up skyward like smoke.&nbsp; Where their shadow touches,
colour dies out of the world.&nbsp; The air grows chill and
deadly as they advance.&nbsp; The trade-wind freshens, the trees
begin to sigh, and all the windmills in Monterey are whirling and
creaking and filling their cisterns with the brackish water of
the sands.&nbsp; It takes but a little while till the invasion is
complete.&nbsp; The sea, in its lighter order, has submerged the
earth.&nbsp; Monterey is curtained in for the night in thick,
wet, salt, and frigid clouds, so to remain till day returns; and
before the sun&rsquo;s rays they slowly disperse and retreat in
broken squadrons to the bosom of the sea.&nbsp; And yet often
when the fog is thickest and most chill, a few steps out of the
town and up the slope, the night will be dry and warm and full of
inland perfume.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Mexicans, Americans, and
Indians</span></h3>
<p>The history of Monterey has yet to be written.&nbsp; Founded
by Catholic missionaries, a place of wise beneficence to Indians,
a place of arms, a Mexican capital continually wrested by one
faction from another, an American capital when the first House of
Representatives held its deliberations, and then falling lower
and lower from the capital of the State to the capital of a
county, and from that again, by the loss of its charter and town
lands, to a mere bankrupt village, its rise and decline is
typical of that of all Mexican institutions and even Mexican
families in California.</p>
<p>Nothing is stranger in that strange State than the rapidity
with which the soil has changed-hands.&nbsp; The Mexicans, you
may say, are all poor and landless, like their former capital;
and yet both it and they hold themselves apart and preserve their
ancient customs and something of their ancient air.</p>
<p>The town, when I was there, was a place of two or three
streets, economically paved with sea-sand, and two or three
lanes, which were watercourses in the rainy season, and were, at
all times, rent up by fissures four or five feet deep.&nbsp;
There were no street lights.&nbsp; Short sections of wooden
sidewalk only added to the dangers of the night, for they were
often high above the level of the roadway, and no one could tell
where they would be likely to begin or end.&nbsp; The houses
were, for the most part, built of unbaked adobe brick, many of
them old for so new a country, some of very elegant proportions,
with low, spacious, shapely rooms, and walls so thick that the
heat of summer never dried them to the heart.&nbsp; At the
approach of the rainy season a deathly chill and a graveyard
smell began to hang about the lower floors; and diseases of the
chest are common and fatal among house-keeping people of either
sex.</p>
<p>There was no activity but in and around the saloons, where
people sat almost all day long playing cards.&nbsp; The smallest
excursion was made on horseback.&nbsp; You would scarcely ever
see the main street without a horse or two tied to posts, and
making a fine figure with their Mexican housings.&nbsp; It struck
me oddly to come across some of the <i>Cornhill</i> illustrations
to Mr. Blackmore&rsquo;s <i>Erema</i>, and see all the characters
astride on English saddles.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, an English
saddle is a rarity even in San Francisco, and, you may say, a
thing unknown in all the rest of California.&nbsp; In a place so
exclusively Mexican as Monterey, you saw not only Mexican saddles
but true Vaquero riding&mdash;men always at the hand-gallop up
hill and down dale, and round the sharpest corner, urging their
horses with cries and gesticulations and cruel rotatory spurs,
checking them dead with a touch, or wheeling them
right-about-face in a square yard.&nbsp; The type of face and
character of bearing are surprisingly un-American.&nbsp; The
first ranged from something like the pure Spanish, to something,
in its sad fixity, not unlike the pure Indian, although I do not
suppose there was one pure blood of either race in all the
country.&nbsp; As for the second, it was a matter of perpetual
surprise to find, in that world of absolutely mannerless
Americans, a people full of deportment, solemnly courteous, and
doing all things with grace and decorum.&nbsp; In dress they ran
to colour and bright sashes.&nbsp; Not even the most Americanised
could always resist the temptation to stick a red rose into his
hat-band.&nbsp; Not even the most Americanised would descend to
wear the vile dress hat of civilisation.&nbsp; Spanish was the
language of the streets.&nbsp; It was difficult to get along
without a word or two of that language for an occasion.&nbsp; The
only communications in which the population joined were with a
view to amusement.&nbsp; A weekly public ball took place with
great etiquette, in addition to the numerous fandangoes in
private houses.&nbsp; There was a really fair amateur brass
band.&nbsp; Night after night serenaders would be going about the
street, sometimes in a company and with several instruments and
voice together, sometimes severally, each guitar before a
different window.&nbsp; It was a strange thing to lie awake in
nineteenth-century America, and hear the guitar accompany, and
one of these old, heart-breaking Spanish love-songs mount into
the night air, perhaps in a deep baritone, perhaps in that
high-pitched, pathetic, womanish alto which is so common among
Mexican men, and which strikes on the unaccustomed ear as
something not entirely human but altogether sad.</p>
<p>The town, then, was essentially and wholly Mexican; and yet
almost all the land in the neighbourhood was held by Americans,
and it was from the same class, numerically so small, that the
principal officials were selected.&nbsp; This Mexican and that
Mexican would describe to you his old family estates, not one
rood of which remained to him.&nbsp; You would ask him how that
came about, and elicit some tangled story back-foremost, from
which you gathered that the Americans had been greedy like
designing men, and the Mexicans greedy like children, but no
other certain fact.&nbsp; Their merits and their faults
contributed alike to the ruin of the former landholders.&nbsp; It
is true they were improvident, and easily dazzled with the sight
of ready money; but they were gentlefolk besides, and that in a
way which curiously unfitted them to combat Yankee craft.&nbsp;
Suppose they have a paper to sign, they would think it a
reflection on the other party to examine the terms with any great
minuteness; nay, suppose them to observe some doubtful clause, it
is ten to one they would refuse from delicacy to object to
it.&nbsp; I know I am speaking within the mark, for I have seen
such a case occur, and the Mexican, in spite of the advice of his
lawyer, has signed the imperfect paper like a lamb.&nbsp; To have
spoken in the matter, he said, above all to have let the other
party guess that he had seen a lawyer, would have &ldquo;been
like doubting his word.&rdquo;&nbsp; The scruple sounds oddly to
one of ourselves, who have been brought up to understand all
business as a competition in fraud, and honesty itself to be a
virtue which regards the carrying out but not the creation of
agreements.&nbsp; This single unworldly trait will account for
much of that revolution of which we are speaking.&nbsp; The
Mexicans have the name of being great swindlers, but certainly
the accusation cuts both ways.&nbsp; In a contest of this sort,
the entire booty would scarcely have passed into the hands of the
more scupulous race.</p>
<p>Physically the Americans have triumphed; but it is not
entirely seen how far they have themselves been morally
conquered.&nbsp; This is, of course, but a part of a part of an
extraordinary problem now in the course of being solved in the
various States of the American Union.&nbsp; I am reminded of an
anecdote.&nbsp; Some years ago, at a great sale of wine, all the
odd lots were purchased by a grocer in a small way in the old
town of Edinburgh.&nbsp; The agent had the curiosity to visit him
some time after and inquire what possible use he could have for
such material.&nbsp; He was shown, by way of answer, a huge vat
where all the liquors, from humble Gladstone to imperial Tokay,
were fermenting together.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; he asked,
&ldquo;do you propose to call this?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
no very sure,&rdquo; replied the grocer, &ldquo;but I think
it&rsquo;s going to turn out port.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the older
Eastern States, I think we may say that this hotch-potch of races
in going to turn out English, or thereabout.&nbsp; But the
problem is indefinitely varied in other zones.&nbsp; The elements
are differently mingled in the south, in what we may call the
Territorial belt and in the group of States on the Pacific
coast.&nbsp; Above all, in these last, we may look to see some
monstrous hybrid&mdash;Whether good or evil, who shall forecast?
but certainly original and all their own.&nbsp; In my little
restaurant at Monterey, we have sat down to table day after day,
a Frenchman, two Portuguese, an Italian, a Mexican, and a
Scotchman: we had for common visitors an American from Illinois,
a nearly pure blood Indian woman, and a naturalised Chinese; and
from time to time a Switzer and a German came down from country
ranches for the night.&nbsp; No wonder that the Pacific coast is
a foreign land to visitors from the Eastern States, for each race
contributes something of its own.&nbsp; Even the despised Chinese
have taught the youth of California, none indeed of their
virtues, but the debasing use of opium.&nbsp; And chief among
these influences is that of the Mexicans.</p>
<p>The Mexicans although in the State are out of it.&nbsp; They
still preserve a sort of international independence, and keep
their affairs snug to themselves.&nbsp; Only four or five years
ago Vasquez, the bandit, his troops being dispersed and the hunt
too hot for him in other parts of California, returned to his
native Monterey, and was seen publicly in her streets and
saloons, fearing no man.&nbsp; The year that I was there, there
occurred two reputed murders.&nbsp; As the Montereyans are
exceptionally vile speakers of each other and of every one behind
his back, it is not possible for me to judge how much truth there
may have been in these reports; but in the one case every one
believed, and in the other some suspected, that there had been
foul play; and nobody dreamed for an instant of taking the
authorities into their counsel.&nbsp; Now this is, of course,
characteristic enough of the Mexicans; but it is a noteworthy
feature that all the Americans in Monterey acquiesced without a
word in this inaction.&nbsp; Even when I spoke to them upon the
subject, they seemed not to understand my surprise; they had
forgotten the traditions of their own race and upbringing, and
become, in a word, wholly Mexicanised.</p>
<p>Again, the Mexicans, having no ready money to speak of, rely
almost entirely in their business transactions upon each
other&rsquo;s worthless paper.&nbsp; Pedro the penniless pays you
with an I O U from the equally penniless Miguel.&nbsp; It is a
sort of local currency by courtesy.&nbsp; Credit in these parts
has passed into a superstition.&nbsp; I have seen a strong,
violent man struggling for months to recover a debt, and getting
nothing but an exchange of waste paper.&nbsp; The very
storekeepers are averse to asking for cash payments, and are more
surprised than pleased when they are offered.&nbsp; They fear
there must be something under it, and that you mean to withdraw
your custom from them.&nbsp; I have seen the enterprising chemist
and stationer begging me with fervour to let my account run on,
although I had my purse open in my hand; and partly from the
commonness of the case, partly from some remains of that generous
old Mexican tradition which made all men welcome to their tables,
a person may be notoriously both unwilling and unable to pay, and
still find credit for the necessaries of life in the stores of
Monterey.&nbsp; Now this villainous habit of living upon
&ldquo;tick&rdquo; has grown into Californian nature.&nbsp; I do
not mean that the American and European storekeepers of Monterey
are as lax as Mexicans; I mean that American farmers in many
parts of the State expect unlimited credit, and profit by it in
the meanwhile, without a thought for consequences.&nbsp; Jew
storekeepers have already learned the advantage to be gained from
this; they lead on the farmer into irretrievable indebtedness,
and keep him ever after as their bond-slave hopelessly grinding
in the mill.&nbsp; So the whirligig of time brings in its
revenges, and except that the Jew knows better than to foreclose,
you may see Americans bound in the same chains with which they
themselves had formerly bound the Mexican.&nbsp; It seems as if
certain sorts of follies, like certain sorts of grain, were
natural to the soil rather than to the race that holds and tills
it for the moment.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, the Americans rule in Monterey
County.&nbsp; The new county seat, Salinas City, in the bald,
corn-bearing plain under the Gabelano Peak, is a town of a purely
American character.&nbsp; The land is held, for the most part, in
those enormous tracts which are another legacy of Mexican days,
and form the present chief danger and disgrace of California; and
the holders are mostly of American or British birth.&nbsp; We
have here in England no idea of the troubles and inconveniences
which flow from the existence of these large
landholders&mdash;land-thieves, land-sharks, or land-grabbers,
they are more commonly and plainly called.&nbsp; Thus the
townlands of Monterey are all in the hands of a single man.&nbsp;
How they came there is an obscure, vexatious question, and,
rightly or wrongly, the man is hated with a great hatred.&nbsp;
His life has been repeatedly in danger.&nbsp; Not very long ago,
I was told, the stage was stopped and examined three evenings in
succession by disguised horsemen thirsting for his blood.&nbsp; A
certain house on the Salinas road, they say, he always passes in
his buggy at full speed, for the squatter sent him warning long
ago.&nbsp; But a year since he was publicly pointed out for death
by no less a man than Mr. Dennis Kearney.&nbsp; Kearney is a man
too well known in California, but a word of explanation is
required for English readers.&nbsp; Originally an Irish dray-man,
he rose, by his command of bad language, to almost dictatorial
authority in the State; throned it there for six months or so,
his mouth full of oaths, gallowses, and conflagrations; was first
snuffed out last winter by Mr. Coleman, backed by his San
Francisco Vigilantes and three gatling guns; completed his own
ruin by throwing in his lot with the grotesque Green-backer
party; and had at last to be rescued by his old enemies, the
police, out of the hands of his rebellious followers.&nbsp; It
was while he was at the top of his fortune that Kearney visited
Monterey with his battle-cry against Chinese labour, the railroad
monopolists, and the land-thieves; and his one articulate counsel
to the Montereyans was to &ldquo;hang David Jacks.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Had the town been American, in my private opinion, this would
have been done years ago.&nbsp; Land is a subject on which there
is no jesting in the West, and I have seen my friend the lawyer
drive out of Monterey to adjust a competition of titles with the
face of a captain going into battle and his Smith-and-Wesson
convenient to his hand.</p>
<p>On the ranche of another of these landholders you may find our
old friend, the truck system, in full operation.&nbsp; Men live
there, year in year out, to cut timber for a nominal wage, which
is all consumed in supplies.&nbsp; The longer they remain in this
desirable service the deeper they will fall in debt&mdash;a
burlesque injustice in a new country, where labour should be
precious, and one of those typical instances which explains the
prevailing discontent and the success of the demagogue
Kearney.</p>
<p>In a comparison between what was and what is in California,
the praisers of times past will fix upon the Indians of
Carmel.&nbsp; The valley drained by the river so named is a true
Californian valley, bare, dotted with chaparal, overlooked by
quaint, unfinished hills.&nbsp; The Carmel runs by many pleasant
farms, a clear and shallow river, loved by wading kine; and at
last, as it is falling towards a quicksand and the great Pacific,
passes a ruined mission on a hill.&nbsp; From the mission church
the eye embraces a great field of ocean, and the ear is filled
with a continuous sound of distant breakers on the shore.&nbsp;
But the day of the Jesuit has gone by, the day of the Yankee has
succeeded, and there is no one left to care for the converted
savage.&nbsp; The church is roofless and ruinous, sea-breezes and
sea-fogs, and the alternation of the rain and sunshine, daily
widening the breaches and casting the crockets from the
wall.&nbsp; As an antiquity in this new land, a quaint specimen
of missionary architecture, and a memorial of good deeds, it had
a triple claim to preservation from all thinking people; but
neglect and abuse have been its portion.&nbsp; There is no sign
of American interference, save where a headboard has been torn
from a grave to be a mark for pistol bullets.&nbsp; So it is with
the Indians for whom it was erected.&nbsp; Their lands, I was
told, are being yearly encroached upon by the neighbouring
American proprietor, and with that exception no man troubles his
head for the Indians of Carmel.&nbsp; Only one day in the year,
the day before our Guy Fawkes, the <i>padre</i> drives over the
hill from Monterey; the little sacristy, which is the only
covered portion of the church, is filled with seats and decorated
for the service; the Indians troop together, their bright dresses
contrasting with their dark and melancholy faces; and there,
among a crowd of somewhat unsympathetic holiday-makers, you may
hear God served with perhaps more touching circumstances than in
any other temple under heaven.&nbsp; An Indian, stone-blind and
about eighty years of age, conducts the singing; other Indians
compose the choir; yet they have the Gregorian music at their
finger ends, and pronounce the Latin so correctly that I could
follow the meaning as they sang.&nbsp; The pronunciation was odd
and nasal, the singing hurried and staccato.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
s&aelig;cula s&aelig;culoho-horum,&rdquo; they went, with a
vigorous aspirate to every additional syllable.&nbsp; I have
never seen faces more vividly lit up with joy than the faces of
these Indian singers.&nbsp; It was to them not only the worship
of God, nor an act by which they recalled and commemorated better
days, but was besides an exercise of culture, where all they knew
of art and letters was united and expressed.&nbsp; And it made a
man&rsquo;s heart sorry for the good fathers of yore who had
taught them to dig and to reap, to read and to sing, who had
given them European mass-books which they still preserve and
study in their cottages, and who had now passed away from all
authority and influence in that land&mdash;to be succeeded by
greedy land-thieves and sacrilegious pistol-shots.&nbsp; So ugly
a thing may our Anglo-Saxon Protestantism appear beside the
doings of the Society of Jesus.</p>
<p>But revolution in this world succeeds to revolution.&nbsp; All
that I say in this paper is in a paulo-past tense.&nbsp; The
Monterey of last year exists no longer.&nbsp; A huge hotel has
sprung up in the desert by the railway.&nbsp; Three sets of
diners sit down successively to table.&nbsp; Invaluable toilettes
figure along the beach and between the live oaks; and Monterey is
advertised in the newspapers, and posted in the waiting-rooms at
railway stations, as a resort for wealth and fashion.&nbsp; Alas
for the little town! it is not strong enough to resist the
influence of the flaunting caravanserai, and the poor, quaint,
penniless native gentlemen of Monterey must perish, like a lower
race, before the millionaire vulgarians of the Big Bonanza.</p>

FONTAINEBLEAU<br />
<span class="smcap">Village Communities of Painters</span></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> charm of Fontainebleau is a
thing apart.&nbsp; It is a place that people love even more than
they admire.&nbsp; The vigorous forest air, the silence, the
majestic avenues of highway, the wilderness of tumbled boulders,
the great age and dignity of certain groves&mdash;these are but
ingredients, they are not the secret of the philtre.&nbsp; The
place is sanative; the air, the light, the perfumes, and the
shapes of things concord in happy harmony.&nbsp; The artist may
be idle and not fear the &ldquo;blues.&rdquo;&nbsp; He may dally
with his life.&nbsp; Mirth, lyric mirth, and a vivacious
classical contentment are of the very essence of the better kind
of art; and these, in that most smiling forest, he has the chance
to learn or to remember.&nbsp; Even on the plain of Bi&eacute;re,
where the Angelus of Millet still tolls upon the ear of fancy, a
larger air, a higher heaven, something ancient and healthy in the
face of nature, purify the mind alike from dulness and
hysteria.&nbsp; There is no place where the young are more gladly
conscious of their youth, or the old better contented with their
age.</p>
<p>The fact of its great and special beauty further recommends
this country to the artist.&nbsp; The field was chosen by men in
whose blood there still raced some of the gleeful or solemn
exultation of great art&mdash;Millet who loved dignity like
Michelangelo, Rousseau whose modern brush was dipped in the
glamour of the ancients.&nbsp; It was chosen before the day of
that strange turn in the history of art, of which we now perceive
the culmination in impressionistic tales and pictures&mdash;that
voluntary aversion of the eye from all speciously strong and
beautiful effects&mdash;that disinterested love of dulness which
has set so many Peter Bells to paint the river-side
primrose.&nbsp; It was then chosen for its proximity to
Paris.&nbsp; And for the same cause, and by the force of
tradition, the painter of to-day continues to inhabit and to
paint it.&nbsp; There is in France scenery incomparable for
romance and harmony.&nbsp; Provence, and the valley of the Rhone
from Vienne to Tarascon, are one succession of masterpieces
waiting for the brush.&nbsp; The beauty is not merely beauty; it
tells, besides, a tale to the imagination, and surprises while it
charms.&nbsp; Here you shall see castellated towns that would
befit the scenery of dreamland; streets that glow with colour
like cathedral windows; hills of the most exquisite proportions;
flowers of every precious colour, growing thick like grass.&nbsp;
All these, by the grace of railway travel, are brought to the
very door of the modern painter; yet he does not seek them; he
remains faithful to Fontainebleau, to the eternal bridge of
Gretz, to the watering-pot cascade in Cernay valley.&nbsp; Even
Fontainebleau was chosen for him; even in Fontainebleau he
shrinks from what is sharply charactered.&nbsp; But one thing, at
least, is certain, whatever he may choose to paint and in
whatever manner, it is good for the artist to dwell among
graceful shapes.&nbsp; Fontainebleau, if it be but quiet scenery,
is classically graceful; and though the student may look for
different qualities, this quality, silently present, will educate
his hand and eye.</p>
<p>But, before all its other advantages&mdash;charm, loveliness,
or proximity to Paris&mdash;comes the great fact that it is
already colonised.&nbsp; The institution of a painters&rsquo;
colony is a work of time and tact.&nbsp; The population must be
conquered.&nbsp; The innkeeper has to be taught, and he soon
learns, the lesson of unlimited credit; he must be taught to
welcome as a favoured guest a young gentleman in a very greasy
coat, and with little baggage beyond a box of colours and a
canvas; and he must learn to preserve his faith in customers who
will eat heartily and drink of the best, borrow money to buy
tobacco, and perhaps not pay a stiver for a year.&nbsp; A colour
merchant has next to be attracted.&nbsp; A certain vogue must be
given to the place, lest the painter, most gregarious of animals,
should find himself alone.&nbsp; And no sooner are these first
difficulties overcome, than fresh perils spring up upon the other
side; and the bourgeois and the tourist are knocking at the
gate.&nbsp; This is the crucial moment for the colony.&nbsp; If
these intruders gain a footing, they not only banish freedom and
amenity; pretty soon, by means of their long purses, they will
have undone the education of the innkeeper; prices will rise and
credit shorten; and the poor painter must fare farther on and
find another hamlet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not here, O Apollo!&rdquo; will
become his song.&nbsp; Thus Trouville and, the other day, St.
Raphael were lost to the arts.&nbsp; Curious and not always
edifying are the shifts that the French student uses to defend
his lair; like the cuttlefish, he must sometimes blacken the
waters of his chosen pool; but at such a time and for so
practical a purpose Mrs. Grundy must allow him licence.&nbsp;
Where his own purse and credit are not threatened, he will do the
honours of his village generously.&nbsp; Any artist is made
welcome, through whatever medium he may seek expression; science
is respected; even the idler, if he prove, as he so rarely does,
a gentleman, will soon begin to find himself at home.&nbsp; And
when that essentially modern creature, the English or American
girl-student, began to walk calmly into his favourite inns as if
into a drawing-room at home, the French painter owned himself
defenceless; he submitted or he fled.&nbsp; His French
respectability, quite as precise as ours, though covering
different provinces of life, recoiled aghast before the
innovation.&nbsp; But the girls were painters; there was nothing
to be done; and Barbizon, when I last saw it and for the time at
least, was practically ceded to the fair invader.&nbsp;
Paterfamilias, on the other hand, the common tourist, the holiday
shopman, and the cheap young gentleman upon the spree, he hounded
from his villages with every circumstance of contumely.</p>
<p>This purely artistic society is excellent for the young
artist.&nbsp; The lads are mostly fools; they hold the latest
orthodoxy in its crudeness; they are at that stage of education,
for the most part, when a man is too much occupied with style to
be aware of the necessity for any matter; and this, above all for
the Englishman, is excellent.&nbsp; To work grossly at the trade,
to forget sentiment, to think of his material and nothing else,
is, for awhile at least, the king&rsquo;s highway of
progress.&nbsp; Here, in England, too many painters and writers
dwell dispersed, unshielded, among the intelligent
bourgeois.&nbsp; These, when they are not merely indifferent,
prate to him about the lofty aims and moral influence of
art.&nbsp; And this is the lad&rsquo;s ruin.&nbsp; For art is,
first of all and last of all, a trade.&nbsp; The love of words
and not a desire to publish new discoveries, the love of form and
not a novel reading of historical events, mark the vocation of
the writer and the painter.&nbsp; The arabesque, properly
speaking, and even in literature, is the first fancy of the
artist; he first plays with his material as a child plays with a
kaleidoscope; and he is already in a second stage when he begins
to use his pretty counters for the end of representation.&nbsp;
In that, he must pause long and toil faithfully; that is his
apprenticeship; and it is only the few who will really grow
beyond it, and go forward, fully equipped, to do the business of
real art&mdash;to give life to abstractions and significance and
charm to facts.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, let him dwell much among
his fellow-craftsmen.&nbsp; They alone can take a serious
interest in the childish tasks and pitiful successes of these
years.&nbsp; They alone can behold with equanimity this fingering
of the dumb keyboard, this polishing of empty sentences, this
dull and literal painting of dull and insignificant
subjects.&nbsp; Outsiders will spur him on.&nbsp; They will say,
&ldquo;Why do you not write a great book? paint a great
picture?&rdquo;&nbsp; If his guardian angel fail him, they may
even persuade him to the attempt, and, ten to one, his hand is
coarsened and his style falsified for life.</p>
<p>And this brings me to a warning.&nbsp; The life of the
apprentice to any art is both unstrained and pleasing; it is
strewn with small successes in the midst of a career of failure,
patiently supported; the heaviest scholar is conscious of a
certain progress; and if he come not appreciably nearer to the
art of Shakespeare, grows letter-perfect in the domain of A-B,
ab.&nbsp; But the time comes when a man should cease prelusory
gymnastic, stand up, put a violence upon his will, and, for
better or worse, begin the business of creation.&nbsp; This evil
day there is a tendency continually to postpone: above all with
painters.&nbsp; They have made so many studies that it has become
a habit; they make more, the walls of exhibitions blush with
them; and death finds these aged students still busy with their
horn-book.&nbsp; This class of man finds a congenial home in
artist villages; in the slang of the English colony at Barbizon
we used to call them &ldquo;Snoozers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Continual
returns to the city, the society of men farther advanced, the
study of great works, a sense of humour or, if such a thing is to
be had, a little religion or philosophy, are the means of
treatment.&nbsp; It will be time enough to think of curing the
malady after it has been caught; for to catch it is the very
thing for which you seek that dream-land of the painters&rsquo;
village.&nbsp; &ldquo;Snoozing&rdquo; is a part of the artistic
education; and the rudiments must be learned stupidly, all else
being forgotten, as if they were an object in themselves.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is something, or there seems to be something, in
the very air of France that communicates the love of style.&nbsp;
Precision, clarity, the cleanly and crafty employment of
material, a grace in the handling, apart from any value in the
thought, seem to be acquired by the mere residence; or if not
acquired, become at least the more appreciated.&nbsp; The air of
Paris is alive with this technical inspiration.&nbsp; And to
leave that airy city and awake next day upon the borders of the
forest is but to change externals.&nbsp; The same spirit of
dexterity and finish breathes from the long alleys and the lofty
groves, from the wildernesses that are still pretty in their
confusion, and the great plain that contrives to be decorative in
its emptiness.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>In spite of its really considerable extent, the forest of
Fontainebleau is hardly anywhere tedious.&nbsp; I know the whole
western side of it with what, I suppose, I may call thoroughness;
well enough at least to testify that there is no square mile
without some special character and charm.&nbsp; Such quarters,
for instance, as the Long Rocher, the Bas-Br&eacute;au, and the
Reine Blanche, might be a hundred miles apart; they have scarce a
point in common beyond the silence of the birds.&nbsp; The two
last are really conterminous; and in both are tall and ancient
trees that have outlived a thousand political vicissitudes.&nbsp;
But in the one the great oaks prosper placidly upon an even
floor; they beshadow a great field; and the air and the light are
very free below their stretching boughs.&nbsp; In the other the
trees find difficult footing; castles of white rock lie tumbled
one upon another, the foot slips, the crooked viper slumbers, the
moss clings in the crevice; and above it all the great beech goes
spiring and casting forth her arms, and, with a grace beyond
church architecture, canopies this rugged chaos.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
dividing the two cantons, the broad white causeway of the Paris
road runs in an avenue: a road conceived for pageantry and for
triumphal marches, an avenue for an army; but, its days of glory
over, it now lies grilling in the sun between cool groves, and
only at intervals the vehicle of the cruising tourist is seen far
away and faintly audible along its ample sweep.&nbsp; A little
upon one side, and you find a district of sand and birch and
boulder; a little upon the other lies the valley of Apremont, all
juniper and heather; and close beyond that you may walk into a
zone of pine trees.&nbsp; So artfully are the ingredients
mingled.&nbsp; Nor must it be forgotten that, in all this part,
you come continually forth upon a hill-top, and behold the plain,
northward and westward, like an unrefulgent sea; nor that all day
long the shadows keep changing; and at last, to the red fires of
sunset, night succeeds, and with the night a new forest, full of
whisper, gloom, and fragrance.&nbsp; There are few things more
renovating than to leave Paris, the lamplit arches of the
Carrousel, and the long alignment of the glittering streets, and
to bathe the senses in this fragrant darkness of the wood.</p>
<p>In this continual variety the mind is kept vividly
alive.&nbsp; It is a changeful place to paint, a stirring place
to live in.&nbsp; As fast as your foot carries you, you pass from
scene to scene, each vigorously painted in the colours of the
sun, each endeared by that hereditary spell of forests on the
mind of man who still remembers and salutes the ancient refuge of
his race.</p>
<p>And yet the forest has been civilised throughout.&nbsp; The
most savage corners bear a name, and have been cherished like
antiquities; in the most remote, Nature has prepared and balanced
her effects as if with conscious art; and man, with his guiding
arrows of blue paint, has countersigned the picture.&nbsp; After
your farthest wandering, you are never surprised to come forth
upon the vast avenue of highway, to strike the centre point of
branching alleys, or to find the aqueduct trailing,
thousand-footed, through the brush.&nbsp; It is not a wilderness;
it is rather a preserve.&nbsp; And, fitly enough, the centre of
the maze is not a hermit&rsquo;s cavern.&nbsp; In the midst, a
little mirthful town lies sunlit, humming with the business of
pleasure; and the palace, breathing distinction and peopled by
historic names, stands smokeless among gardens.</p>
<p>Perhaps the last attempt at savage life was that of the
harmless humbug who called himself the hermit.&nbsp; In a great
tree, close by the highroad, he had built himself a little cabin
after the manner of the Swiss Family Robinson; thither he mounted
at night, by the romantic aid of a rope ladder; and if dirt be
any proof of sincerity, the man was savage as a Sioux.&nbsp; I
had the pleasure of his acquaintance; he appeared grossly stupid,
not in his perfect wits, and interested in nothing but small
change; for that he had a great avidity.&nbsp; In the course of
time he proved to be a chicken-stealer, and vanished from his
perch; and perhaps from the first he was no true votary of forest
freedom, but an ingenious, theatrically-minded beggar, and his
cabin in the tree was only stock-in-trade to beg withal.&nbsp;
The choice of his position would seem to indicate so much; for if
in the forest there are no places still to be discovered, there
are many that have been forgotten, and that lie unvisited.&nbsp;
There, to be sure, are the blue arrows waiting to reconduct you,
now blazed upon a tree, now posted in the corner of a rock.&nbsp;
But your security from interruption is complete; you might camp
for weeks, if there were only water, and not a soul suspect your
presence; and if I may suppose the reader to have committed some
great crime and come to me for aid, I think I could still find my
way to a small cavern, fitted with a hearth and chimney, where he
might lie perfectly concealed.&nbsp; A confederate
landscape-painter might daily supply him with food; for water, he
would have to make a nightly tramp as far as to the nearest pond;
and at last, when the hue and cry began to blow over, he might
get gently on the train at some side station, work round by a
series of junctions, and be quietly captured at the frontier.</p>
<p>Thus Fontainebleau, although it is truly but a
pleasure-ground, and although, in favourable weather, and in the
more celebrated quarters, it literally buzzes with the tourist,
yet has some of the immunities and offers some of the repose of
natural forests.&nbsp; And the solitary, although he must return
at night to his frequented inn, may yet pass the day with his own
thoughts in the companionable silence of the trees.&nbsp; The
demands of the imagination vary; some can be alone in a back
garden looked upon by windows; others, like the ostrich, are
content with a solitude that meets the eye; and others, again,
expand in fancy to the very borders of their desert, and are
irritably conscious of a hunter&rsquo;s camp in an adjacent
county.&nbsp; To these last, of course, Fontainebleau will seem
but an extended tea-garden: a Rosherville on a by-day.&nbsp; But
to the plain man it offers solitude: an excellent thing in
itself, and a good whet for company.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>I was for some time a consistent Barbizonian; <i>et ego in
Arcadia vixi</i>, it was a pleasant season; and that noiseless
hamlet lying close among the borders of the wood is for me, as
for so many others, a green spot in memory.&nbsp; The great
Millet was just dead, the green shutters of his modest house were
closed; his daughters were in mourning.&nbsp; The date of my
first visit was thus an epoch in the history of art: in a lesser
way, it was an epoch in the history of the Latin Quarter.&nbsp;
The <i>Petit C&eacute;nacle</i> was dead and buried; Murger and
his crew of sponging vagabonds were all at rest from their
expedients; the tradition of their real life was nearly lost; and
the petrified legend of the <i>Vie de Boh&eacute;me</i> had
become a sort of gospel, and still gave the cue to zealous
imitators.&nbsp; But if the book be written in rose-water, the
imitation was still farther expurgated; honesty was the rule; the
innkeepers gave, as I have said, almost unlimited credit; they
suffered the seediest painter to depart, to take all his
belongings, and to leave his bill unpaid; and if they sometimes
lost, it was by English and Americans alone.&nbsp; At the same
time, the great influx of Anglo-Saxons had begun to affect the
life of the studious.&nbsp; There had been disputes; and, in one
instance at least, the English and the Americans had made common
cause to prevent a cruel pleasantry.&nbsp; It would be well if
nations and races could communicate their qualities; but in
practice when they look upon each other, they have an eye to
nothing but defects.&nbsp; The Anglo-Saxon is essentially
dishonest; the French is devoid by nature of the principle that
we call &ldquo;Fair Play.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Frenchman marvelled at
the scruples of his guest, and, when that defender of innocence
retired over-seas and left his bills unpaid, he marvelled once
again; the good and evil were, in his eyes, part and parcel of
the same eccentricity; a shrug expressed his judgment upon
both.</p>
<p>At Barbizon there was no master, no pontiff in the arts.&nbsp;
Palizzi bore rule at Gretz&mdash;urbane, superior rule&mdash;his
memory rich in anecdotes of the great men of yore, his mind
fertile in theories; sceptical, composed, and venerable to the
eye; and yet beneath these outworks, all twittering with Italian
superstition, his eye scouting for omens, and the whole fabric of
his manners giving way on the appearance of a hunchback.&nbsp;
Cernay had Pelouse, the admirable, placid Pelouse, smilingly
critical of youth, who, when a full-blown commercial traveller,
suddenly threw down his samples, bought a colour-box, and became
the master whom we have all admired.&nbsp; Marlotte, for a
central figure, boasted Olivier de Penne.&nbsp; Only Barbizon,
since the death of Millet, was a headless commonwealth.&nbsp;
Even its secondary lights, and those who in my day made the
stranger welcome, have since deserted it.&nbsp; The good
Lach&egrave;vre has departed, carrying his household gods; and
long before that Gaston Lafenestre was taken from our midst by an
untimely death.&nbsp; He died before he had deserved success; it
may be, he would never have deserved it; but his kind, comely,
modest countenance still haunts the memory of all who knew
him.&nbsp; Another&mdash;whom I will not name&mdash;has moved
farther on, pursuing the strange Odyssey of his decadence.&nbsp;
His days of royal favour had departed even then; but he still
retained, in his narrower life at Barbizon, a certain stamp of
conscious importance, hearty, friendly, filling the room, the
occupant of several chairs; nor had he yet ceased his losing
battle, still labouring upon great canvases that none would buy,
still waiting the return of fortune.&nbsp; But these days also
were too good to last; and the former favourite of two sovereigns
fled, if I heard the truth, by night.&nbsp; There was a time when
he was counted a great man, and Millet but a dauber; behold, how
the whirligig of time brings in his revenges!&nbsp; To pity
Millet is a piece of arrogance; if life be hard for such resolute
and pious spirits, it is harder still for us, had we the wit to
understand it; but we may pity his unhappier rival, who, for no
apparent merit, was raised to opulence and momentary fame, and,
through no apparent fault was suffered step by step to sink again
to nothing.&nbsp; No misfortune can exceed the bitterness of such
back-foremost progress, even bravely supported as it was; but to
those also who were taken early from the easel, a regret is
due.&nbsp; From all the young men of this period, one stood out
by the vigour of his promise; he was in the age of fermentation,
enamoured of eccentricities.&nbsp; &ldquo;Il faut faire de la
peinture nouvelle,&rdquo; was his watchword; but if time and
experience had continued his education, if he had been granted
health to return from these excursions to the steady and the
central, I must believe that the name of Hills had become
famous.</p>
<p>Siron&rsquo;s inn, that excellent artists&rsquo; barrack, was
managed upon easy principles.&nbsp; At any hour of the night,
when you returned from wandering in the forest, you went to the
billiard-room and helped yourself to liquors, or descended to the
cellar and returned laden with beer or wine.&nbsp; The Sirons
were all locked in slumber; there was none to check your inroads;
only at the week&rsquo;s end a computation was made, the gross
sum was divided, and a varying share set down to every
lodger&rsquo;s name under the rubric: <i>estrats</i>.&nbsp; Upon
the more long-suffering the larger tax was levied; and your bill
lengthened in a direct proportion to the easiness of your
disposition.&nbsp; At any hour of the morning, again, you could
get your coffee or cold milk, and set forth into the
forest.&nbsp; The doves had perhaps wakened you, fluttering into
your chamber; and on the threshold of the inn you were met by the
aroma of the forest.&nbsp; Close by were the great aisles, the
mossy boulders, the interminable field of forest shadow.&nbsp;
There you were free to dream and wander.&nbsp; And at noon, and
again at six o&rsquo;clock, a good meal awaited you on
Siron&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; The whole of your accommodation, set
aside that varying item of the <i>estrals</i>, cost you five
francs a day; your bill was never offered you until you asked it;
and if you were out of luck&rsquo;s way, you might depart for
where you pleased and leave it pending.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>Theoretically, the house was open to all corners; practically,
it was a kind of club.&nbsp; The guests protected themselves,
and, in so doing, they protected Siron.&nbsp; Formal manners
being laid aside, essential courtesy was the more rigidly
exacted; the new arrival had to feel the pulse of the society;
and a breach of its undefined observances was promptly
punished.&nbsp; A man might be as plain, as dull, as slovenly, as
free of speech as he desired; but to a touch of presumption or a
word of hectoring these free Barbizonians were as sensitive as a
tea-party of maiden ladies.&nbsp; I have seen people driven forth
from Barbizon; it would be difficult to say in words what they
had done, but they deserved their fate.&nbsp; They had shown
themselves unworthy to enjoy these corporate freedoms; they had
pushed themselves; they had &ldquo;made their head&rdquo;; they
wanted tact to appreciate the &ldquo;fine shades&rdquo; of
Barbizonian etiquette.&nbsp; And once they were condemned, the
process of extrusion was ruthless in its cruelty; after one
evening with the formidable Bodmer, the Baily of our
commonwealth, the erring stranger was beheld no more; he rose
exceeding early the next day, and the first coach conveyed him
from the scene of his discomfiture.&nbsp; These sentences of
banishment were never, in my knowledge, delivered against an
artist; such would, I believe, have been illegal; but the odd and
pleasant fact is this, that they were never needed.&nbsp;
Painters, sculptors, writers, singers, I have seen all of these
in Barbizon; and some were sulky, and some blatant and inane; but
one and all entered at once into the spirit of the
association.&nbsp; This singular society is purely French, a
creature of French virtues, and possibly of French defects.&nbsp;
It cannot be imitated by the English.&nbsp; The roughness, the
impatience, the more obvious selfishness, and even the more
ardent friendships of the Anglo-Saxon, speedily dismember such a
commonwealth.&nbsp; But this random gathering of young French
painters, with neither apparatus nor parade of government, yet
kept the life of the place upon a certain footing, insensibly
imposed their etiquette upon the docile, and by caustic speech
enforced their edicts against the unwelcome.&nbsp; To think of it
is to wonder the more at the strange failure of their race upon
the larger theatre.&nbsp; This inbred civility&mdash;to use the
word in its completest meaning&mdash;this natural and facile
adjustment of contending liberties, seems all that is required to
make a governable nation and a just and prosperous country.</p>
<p>Our society, thus purged and guarded, was full of high
spirits, of laughter, and of the initiative of youth.&nbsp; The
few elder men who joined us were still young at heart, and took
the key from their companions.&nbsp; We returned from long
stations in the fortifying air, our blood renewed by the
sunshine, our spirits refreshed by the silence of the forest; the
Babel of loud voices sounded good; we fell to eat and play like
the natural man; and in the high inn chamber, panelled with
indifferent pictures and lit by candles guttering in the night
air, the talk and laughter sounded far into the night.&nbsp; It
was a good place and a good life for any naturally-minded youth;
better yet for the student of painting, and perhaps best of all
for the student of letters.&nbsp; He, too, was saturated in this
atmosphere of style; he was shut out from the disturbing currents
of the world, he might forget that there existed other and more
pressing interests than that of art.&nbsp; But, in such a place,
it was hardly possible to write; he could not drug his
conscience, like the painter, by the production of listless
studies; he saw himself idle among many who were apparently, and
some who were really, employed; and what with the impulse of
increasing health and the continual provocation of romantic
scenes, he became tormented with the desire to work.&nbsp; He
enjoyed a strenuous idleness full of visions, hearty meals, long,
sweltering walks, mirth among companions; and still floating like
music through his brain, foresights of great works that
Shakespeare might be proud to have conceived, headless epics,
glorious torsos of dramas, and words that were alive with
import.&nbsp; So in youth, like Moses from the mountain, we have
sights of that House Beautiful of art which we shall never
enter.&nbsp; They are dreams and unsubstantial; visions of style
that repose upon no base of human meaning; the last heart-throbs
of that excited amateur who has to die in all of us before the
artist can be born.&nbsp; But they come to us in such a rainbow
of glory that all subsequent achievement appears dull and earthly
in comparison.&nbsp; We were all artists; almost all in the age
of illusion, cultivating an imaginary genius, and walking to the
strains of some deceiving Ariel; small wonder, indeed, if we were
happy!&nbsp; But art, of whatever nature, is a kind mistress; and
though these dreams of youth fall by their own baselessness,
others succeed, graver and more substantial; the symptoms change,
the amiable malady endures; and still, at an equal distance, the
House Beautiful shines upon its hill-top.</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>Gretz lies out of the forest, down by the bright river.&nbsp;
It boasts a mill, an ancient church, a castle, and a bridge of
many sterlings.&nbsp; And the bridge is a piece of public
property; anonymously famous; beaming on the incurious dilettante
from the walls of a hundred exhibitions.&nbsp; I have seen it in
the Salon; I have seen it in the Academy; I have seen it in the
last French Exposition, excellently done by Bloomer; in a
black-and-white by Mr. A. Henley, it once adorned this essay in
the pages of the <i>Magazine of Art</i>.&nbsp; Long-suffering
bridge!&nbsp; And if you visit Gretz to-morrow, you shall find
another generation, camped at the bottom of Chevillon&rsquo;s
garden under their white umbrellas, and doggedly painting it
again.</p>
<p>The bridge taken for granted, Gretz is a less inspiring place
than Barbizon.&nbsp; I give it the palm over Cernay.&nbsp; There
is something ghastly in the great empty village square of Cernay,
with the inn tables standing in one corner, as though the stage
were set for rustic opera, and in the early morning all the
painters breaking their fast upon white wine under the windows of
the villagers.&nbsp; It is vastly different to awake in Gretz, to
go down the green inn-garden, to find the river streaming through
the bridge, and to see the dawn begin across the poplared
level.&nbsp; The meals are laid in the cool arbour, under
fluttering leaves.&nbsp; The splash of oars and bathers, the
bathing costumes out to dry, the trim canoes beside the jetty,
tell of a society that has an eye to pleasure.&nbsp; There is
&ldquo;something to do&rdquo; at Gretz.&nbsp; Perhaps, for that
very reason, I can recall no such enduring ardours, no such
glories of exhilaration, as among the solemn groves and
uneventful hours of Barbizon.&nbsp; This &ldquo;something to
do&rdquo; is a great enemy to joy; it is a way out of it; you
wreak your high spirits on some cut-and-dry employment, and
behold them gone!&nbsp; But Gretz is a merry place after its
kind: pretty to see, merry to inhabit.&nbsp; The course of its
pellucid river, whether up or down, is full of gentle attractions
for the navigator: islanded reed-mazes where, in autumn, the red
berries cluster; the mirrored and inverted images of trees,
lilies, and mills, and the foam and thunder of weirs.&nbsp; And
of all noble sweeps of roadway, none is nobler, on a windy dusk,
than the highroad to Nemours between its lines of talking
poplar.</p>
<p>But even Gretz is changed.&nbsp; The old inn, long shored and
trussed and buttressed, fell at length under the mere weight of
years, and the place as it was is but a fading image in the
memory of former guests.&nbsp; They, indeed, recall the ancient
wooden stair; they recall the rainy evening, the wide hearth, the
blaze of the twig fire, and the company that gathered round the
pillar in the kitchen.&nbsp; But the material fabric is now dust;
soon, with the last of its inhabitants, its very memory shall
follow; and they, in their turn, shall suffer the same law, and,
both in name and lineament, vanish from the world of men.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For remembrance of the old house&rsquo; sake,&rdquo; as
Pepys once quaintly put it, let me tell one story.&nbsp; When the
tide of invasion swept over France, two foreign painters were
left stranded and penniless in Gretz; and there, until the war
was over, the Chevillons ungrudgingly harboured them.&nbsp; It
was difficult to obtain supplies; but the two waifs were still
welcome to the best, sat down daily with the family to table, and
at the due intervals were supplied with clean napkins, which they
scrupled to employ.&nbsp; Madame Chevillon observed the fact and
reprimanded them.&nbsp; But they stood firm; eat they must, but
having no money they would soil no napkins.</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>Nemours and Moret, for all they are so picturesque, have been
little visited by painters.&nbsp; They are, indeed, too populous;
they have manners of their own, and might resist the drastic
process of colonisation.&nbsp; Montigny has been somewhat
strangely neglected, I never knew it inhabited but once, when
Will H. Low installed himself there with a barrel of
<i>piquette</i>, and entertained his friends in a leafy trellis
above the weir, in sight of the green country and to the music of
the falling water.&nbsp; It was a most airy, quaint, and pleasant
place of residence, just too rustic to be stagey; and from my
memories of the place in general, and that garden trellis in
particular&mdash;at morning, visited by birds, or at night, when
the dew fell and the stars were of the party&mdash;I am inclined
to think perhaps too favourably of the future of Montigny.&nbsp;
Chailly-en-Bi&egrave;re has outlived all things, and lies dustily
slumbering in the plain&mdash;the cemetery of itself.&nbsp; The
great road remains to testify of its former bustle of postilions
and carriage bells; and, like memorial tablets, there still hang
in the inn room the paintings of a former generation, dead or
decorated long ago.&nbsp; In my time, one man only, greatly
daring, dwelt there.&nbsp; From time to time he would walk over
to Barbizon like a shade revisiting the glimpses of the moon, and
after some communication with flesh and blood return to his
austere hermitage.&nbsp; But even he, when I last revisited the
forest, had come to Barbizon for good, and closed the roll of
Chaillyites.&nbsp; It may revive&mdash;but I much doubt it.&nbsp;
Ach&egrave;res and Recloses still wait a pioneer; Bourron is out
of the question, being merely Gretz over again, without the
river, the bridge, or the beauty; and of all the possible places
on the western side, Marlotte alone remains to be
discussed.&nbsp; I scarcely know Marlotte, and, very likely for
that reason, am not much in love with it.&nbsp; It seems a
glaring and unsightly hamlet.&nbsp; The inn of Mother Antonie is
unattractive; and its more reputable rival, though comfortable
enough, is commonplace.&nbsp; Marlotte has a name; it is famous;
if I were the young painter I would leave it alone in its
glory.</p>
<h3>VII</h3>
<p>These are the words of an old stager; and though time is a
good conservative in forest places, much may be untrue
to-day.&nbsp; Many of us have passed Arcadian days there and
moved on, but yet left a portion of our souls behind us buried in
the woods.&nbsp; I would not dig for these reliqui&aelig;; they
are incommunicable treasures that will not enrich the finder; and
yet there may lie, interred below great oaks or scattered along
forest paths, stores of youth&rsquo;s dynamite and dear
remembrances.&nbsp; And as one generation passes on and renovates
the field of tillage for the next, I entertain a fancy that when
the young men of to-day go forth into the forest they shall find
the air still vitalised by the spirits of their predecessors,
and, like those &ldquo;unheard melodies&rdquo; that are the
sweetest of all, the memory of our laughter shall still haunt the
field of trees.&nbsp; Those merry voices that in woods call the
wanderer farther, those thrilling silences and whispers of the
groves, surely in Fontainebleau they must be vocal of me and my
companions?&nbsp; We are not content to pass away entirely from
the scenes of our delight; we would leave, if but in gratitude, a
pillar and a legend.</p>
<p>One generation after another fall like honey-bees upon this
memorable forest, rifle its sweets, pack themselves with vital
memories, and when the theft is consummated depart again into
life richer, but poorer also.&nbsp; The forest, indeed, they have
possessed, from that day forward it is theirs indissolubly, and
they will return to walk in it at night in the fondest of their
dreams, and use it for ever in their books and pictures.&nbsp;
Yet when they made their packets, and put up their notes and
sketches, something, it should seem, had been forgotten.&nbsp; A
projection of themselves shall appear to haunt unfriended these
scenes of happiness, a natural child of fancy, begotten and
forgotten unawares.&nbsp; Over the whole field of our wanderings
such fetches are still travelling like indefatigable bagmen; but
the imps of Fontainebleau, as of all beloved spots, are very long
of life, and memory is piously unwilling to forget their
orphanage.&nbsp; If anywhere about that wood you meet my airy
bantling, greet him with tenderness.&nbsp; He was a pleasant lad,
though now abandoned.&nbsp; And when it comes to your own turn to
quit the forest, may you leave behind you such another; no Antony
or Werther, let us hope, no tearful whipster, but, as becomes
this not uncheerful and most active age in which we figure, the
child of happy hours.</p>
<p>No art, it may be said, was ever perfect, and not many noble,
that has not been mirthfully conceived.</p>
<p>And no man, it may be added, was ever anything but a wet
blanket and a cross to his companions who boasted not a copious
spirit of enjoyment.&nbsp; Whether as man or artist let the youth
make haste to Fontainebleau, and once there let him address
himself to the spirit of the place; he will learn more from
exercise than from studies, although both are necessary; and if
he can get into his heart the gaiety and inspiration of the woods
he will have gone far to undo the evil of his sketches.&nbsp; A
spirit once well strung up to the concert-pitch of the primeval
out-of-doors will hardly dare to finish a study and
magniloquently ticket it a picture.&nbsp; The incommunicable
thrill of things, that is the tuning-fork by which we test the
flatness of our art.&nbsp; Here it is that Nature teaches and
condemns, and still spurs up to further effort and new
failure.&nbsp; Thus it is that she sets us blushing at our
ignorant and tepid works; and the more we find of these inspiring
shocks the less shall we be apt to love the literal in our
productions.&nbsp; In all sciences and senses the letter kills;
and to-day, when cackling human geese express their ignorant
condemnation of all studio pictures, it is a lesson most useful
to be learnt.&nbsp; Let the young painter go to Fontainebleau,
and while he stupefies himself with studies that teach him the
mechanical side of his trade, let him walk in the great air, and
be a servant of mirth, and not pick and botanise, but wait upon
the moods of nature.&nbsp; So he will learn&mdash;or learn not to
forget&mdash;the poetry of life and earth, which, when he has
acquired his track, will save him from joyless reproduction.</p>

EPILOGUE TO &ldquo;AN INLAND VOYAGE&rdquo; <a
name="citation95"></a><a href="#footnote95"
class="citation">[95]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> country where they journeyed,
that green, breezy valley of the Loing, is one very attractive to
cheerful and solitary people.&nbsp; The weather was superb; all
night it thundered and lightened, and the rain fell in sheets; by
day, the heavens were cloudless, the sun fervent, the air
vigorous and pure.&nbsp; They walked separate: the Cigarette
plodding behind with some philosophy, the lean Arethusa posting
on ahead.&nbsp; Thus each enjoyed his own reflections by the way;
each had perhaps time to tire of them before he met his comrade
at the designated inn; and the pleasures of society and solitude
combined to fill the day.&nbsp; The Arethusa carried in his
knapsack the works of Charles of Orleans, and employed some of
the hours of travel in the concoction of English roundels.&nbsp;
In this path, he must thus have preceded Mr. Lang, Mr. Dobson,
Mr. Henley, and all contemporary roundeleers; but for good
reasons, he will be the last to publish the result.&nbsp; The
Cigarette walked burthened with a volume of Michelet.&nbsp; And
both these books, it will be seen, played a part in the
subsequent adventure.</p>
<p>The Arethusa was unwisely dressed.&nbsp; He is no precisian in
attire; but by all accounts, he was never so ill-inspired as on
that tramp; having set forth indeed, upon a moment&rsquo;s
notice, from the most unfashionable spot in Europe,
Barbizon.&nbsp; On his head he wore a smoking-cap of Indian work,
the gold lace pitifully frayed and tarnished.&nbsp; A flannel
shirt of an agreeable dark hue, which the satirical called black;
a light tweed coat made by a good English tailor; ready-made
cheap linen trousers and leathern gaiters completed his
array.&nbsp; In person, he is exceptionally lean; and his face is
not, like those of happier mortals, a certificate.&nbsp; For
years he could not pass a frontier or visit a bank without
suspicion; the police everywhere, but in his native city, looked
askance upon him; and (though I am sure it will not be credited)
he is actually denied admittance to the casino of Monte
Carlo.&nbsp; If you will imagine him, dressed as above, stooping
under his knapsack, walking nearly five miles an hour with the
folds of the ready-made trousers fluttering about his spindle
shanks, and still looking eagerly round him as if in terror of
pursuit&mdash;the figure, when realised, is far from
reassuring.&nbsp; When Villon journeyed (perhaps by the same
pleasant valley) to his exile at Roussillon, I wonder if he had
not something of the same appearance.&nbsp; Something of the same
preoccupation he had beyond a doubt, for he too must have
tinkered verses as he walked, with more success than his
successor.&nbsp; And if he had anything like the same inspiring
weather, the same nights of uproar, men in armour rolling and
resounding down the stairs of heaven, the rain hissing on the
village streets, the wild bull&rsquo;s-eye of the storm flashing
all night long into the bare inn-chamber&mdash;the same sweet
return of day, the same unfathomable blue of noon, the same
high-coloured, halcyon eves&mdash;and above all, if he had
anything like as good a comrade, anything like as keen a relish
for what he saw, and what he ate, and the rivers that he bathed
in, and the rubbish that he wrote, I would exchange estates
to-day with the poor exile, and count myself a gainer.</p>
<p>But there was another point of similarity between the two
journeys, for which the Arethusa was to pay dear: both were gone
upon in days of incomplete security.&nbsp; It was not long after
the Franco-Prussian war.&nbsp; Swiftly as men forget, that
country-side was still alive with tales of uhlans, and outlying
sentries, and hairbreadth &rsquo;scapes from the ignominious
cord, and pleasant momentary friendships between invader and
invaded.&nbsp; A year, at the most two years later, you might
have tramped all that country over and not heard one
anecdote.&nbsp; And a year or two later, you would&mdash;if you
were a rather ill-looking young man in nondescript
array&mdash;have gone your rounds in greater safety; for along
with more interesting matter, the Prussian spy would have
somewhat faded from men&rsquo;s imaginations.</p>
<p>For all that, our voyager had got beyond Ch&acirc;teau Renard
before he was conscious of arousing wonder.&nbsp; On the road
between that place and Ch&acirc;tillon-sur-Loing, however, he
encountered a rural postman; they fell together in talk, and
spoke of a variety of subjects; but through one and all, the
postman was still visibly preoccupied, and his eyes were faithful
to the Arethusa&rsquo;s knapsack.&nbsp; At last, with mysterious
roguishness, he inquired what it contained, and on being
answered, shook his head with kindly incredulity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Non</i>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;<i>non</i>, <i>vous
avez des portraits</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then with a languishing
appeal, &ldquo;<i>Voyons</i>, show me the portraits!&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was some little while before the Arethusa, with a shout of
laughter, recognised his drift.&nbsp; By portraits he meant
indecent photographs; and in the Arethusa, an austere and rising
author, he thought to have identified a pornographic
colporteur.&nbsp; When countryfolk in France have made up their
minds as to a person&rsquo;s calling, argument is
fruitless.&nbsp; Along all the rest of the way, the postman piped
and fluted meltingly to get a sight of the collection; now he
would upbraid, now he would reason&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Voyons</i>, I
will tell nobody&rdquo;; then he tried corruption, and insisted
on paying for a glass of wine; and, at last when their ways
separated&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Non</i>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;<i>ce
n&rsquo;est pas bien de votre part</i>.&nbsp; <i>O non</i>, <i>ce
n&rsquo;est pas bien</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And shaking his head with
quite a sentimental sense of injury, he departed unrefreshed.</p>
<p>On certain little difficulties encountered by the Arethusa at
Ch&acirc;tillon-sur-Loing, I have not space to dwell; another
Ch&acirc;tillon, of grislier memory, looms too near at
hand.&nbsp; But the next day, in a certain hamlet called La
Jussi&eacute;re, he stopped to drink a glass of syrup in a very
poor, bare drinking shop.&nbsp; The hostess, a comely woman,
suckling a child, examined the traveller with kindly and pitying
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not of this department?&rdquo; she
asked.&nbsp; The Arethusa told her he was English.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, surprised.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have no
English.&nbsp; We have many Italians, however, and they do very
well; they do not complain of the people of hereabouts.&nbsp; An
Englishman may do very well also; it will be something
new.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here was a dark saying, over which the Arethusa
pondered as he drank his grenadine; but when he rose and asked
what was to pay, the light came upon him in a flash.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>O</i>, <i>pour vous</i>,&rdquo; replied the landlady,
&ldquo;a halfpenny!&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Pour vous</i>?&nbsp; By
heaven, she took him for a beggar!&nbsp; He paid his halfpenny,
feeling that it were ungracious to correct her.&nbsp; But when he
was forth again upon the road, he became vexed in spirit.&nbsp;
The conscience is no gentleman, he is a rabbinical fellow; and
his conscience told him he had stolen the syrup.</p>
<p>That night the travellers slept in Gien; the next day they
passed the river and set forth (severally, as their custom was)
on a short stage through the green plain upon the Berry side, to
Ch&acirc;tillon-sur-Loire.&nbsp; It was the first day of the
shooting; and the air rang with the report of firearms and the
admiring cries of sportsmen.&nbsp; Overhead the birds were in
consternation, wheeling in clouds, settling and re-arising.&nbsp;
And yet with all this bustle on either hand, the road itself lay
solitary.&nbsp; The Arethusa smoked a pipe beside a milestone,
and I remember he laid down very exactly all he was to do at
Ch&acirc;tillon: how he was to enjoy a cold plunge, to change his
shirt, and to await the Cigarette&rsquo;s arrival, in sublime
inaction, by the margin of the Loire.&nbsp; Fired by these ideas,
he pushed the more rapidly forward, and came, early in the
afternoon and in a breathing heat, to the entering-in of that
ill-fated town.&nbsp; Childe Roland to the dark tower came.</p>
<p>A polite gendarme threw his shadow on the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Monsieur est voyageur</i>?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>And the Arethusa, strong in his innocence, forgetful of his
vile attire, replied&mdash;I had almost said with gaiety:
&ldquo;So it would appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His papers are in order?&rdquo; said the
gendarme.&nbsp; And when the Arethusa, with a slight change of
voice, admitted he had none, he was informed (politely enough)
that he must appear before the Commissary.</p>
<p>The Commissary sat at a table in his bedroom, stripped to the
shirt and trousers, but still copiously perspiring; and when he
turned upon the prisoner a large meaningless countenance, that
was (like Bardolph&rsquo;s) &ldquo;all whelks and
bubuckles,&rdquo; the dullest might have been prepared for
grief.&nbsp; Here was a stupid man, sleepy with the heat and
fretful at the interruption, whom neither appeal nor argument
could reach.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Commissary</span>.&nbsp; You have no
papers?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Not here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Commissary</span>.&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; I have left
them behind in my valise.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Commissary</span>.&nbsp; You know,
however, that it is forbidden to circulate without papers?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Pardon me: I am
convinced of the contrary.&nbsp; I am here on my rights as an
English subject by international treaty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Commissary</span> (<i>with
scorn</i>).&nbsp; You call yourself an Englishman?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; I do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Commissary</span>.&nbsp;
Humph.&mdash;What is your trade?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; I am a Scotch
advocate.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Commissary</span> (<i>with singular
annoyance</i>).&nbsp; A Scotch advocate!&nbsp; Do you then
pretend to support yourself by that in this department?</p>
<p>The Arethusa modestly disclaimed the pretension.&nbsp; The
Commissary had scored a point.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Commissary</span>.&nbsp; Why, then, do
you travel?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; I travel for
pleasure.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Commissary</span> (<i>pointing to the
knapsack</i>, <i>and with sublime incredulity</i>).&nbsp; <i>Avec
&ccedil;a</i>?&nbsp; <i>Voyez-vous</i>, <i>je suis un homme
intelligent</i>!&nbsp; (With that?&nbsp; Look here, I am a person
of intelligence!)</p>
<p>The culprit remaining silent under this home thrust, the
Commissary relished his triumph for a while, and then demanded
(like the postman, but with what different expectations!) to see
the contents of the knapsack.&nbsp; And here the Arethusa, not
yet sufficiently awake to his position, fell into a grave
mistake.&nbsp; There was little or no furniture in the room
except the Commissary&rsquo;s chair and table; and to facilitate
matters, the Arethusa (with all the innocence on earth) leant the
knapsack on a corner of the bed.&nbsp; The Commissary fairly
bounded from his seat; his face and neck flushed past purple,
almost into blue; and he screamed to lay the desecrating object
on the floor.</p>
<p>The knapsack proved to contain a change of shirts, of shoes,
of socks, and of linen trousers, a small dressing-case, a piece
of soap in one of the shoes, two volumes of the <i>Collection
Jannet</i> lettered <i>Po&eacute;sies de Charles
d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans</i>, a map, and a version book containing
divers notes in prose and the remarkable English roundels of the
voyager, still to this day unpublished: the Commissary of
Ch&acirc;tillon is the only living man who has clapped an eye on
these artistic trifles.&nbsp; He turned the assortment over with
a contumelious finger; it was plain from his daintiness that he
regarded the Arethusa and all his belongings as the very temple
of infection.&nbsp; Still there was nothing suspicious about the
map, nothing really criminal except the roundels; as for Charles
of Orleans, to the ignorant mind of the prisoner, he seemed as
good as a certificate; and it was supposed the farce was nearly
over.</p>
<p>The inquisitor resumed his seat.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Commissary</span> (<i>after a
pause</i>).&nbsp; <i>Eh bien</i>, <i>je vais vous dire ce que
vous &ecirc;tes</i>.&nbsp; <i>Vous &ecirc;tes allemand et vous
venez chanter &agrave; la foire</i>.&nbsp; (Well, then, I will
tell you what you are.&nbsp; You are a German and have come to
sing at the fair.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Would you like
to hear me sing?&nbsp; I believe I could convince you of the
contrary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Commissary</span>.&nbsp; <i>Pas de
plaisanterie</i>, <i>monsieur</i>!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Well, sir,
oblige me at least by looking at this book.&nbsp; Here, I open it
with my eyes shut.&nbsp; Read one of these songs&mdash;read this
one&mdash;and tell me, you who are a man of intelligence, if it
would be possible to sing it at a fair?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Commissary</span>
(<i>critically</i>).&nbsp; <i>Mais oui</i>.&nbsp; <i>Tr&egrave;s
bien</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; <i>Comment</i>,
<i>monsieur</i>!&nbsp; What!&nbsp; But do you not observe it is
antique.&nbsp; It is difficult to understand, even for you and
me; but for the audience at a fair, it would be meaningless.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Commissary</span> (<i>taking a
pen</i>).&nbsp; <i>Enfin</i>, <i>il faui en finir</i>.&nbsp; What
is your name?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Arethusa</span> (<i>speaking with the
swallowing vivacity of the English</i>).&nbsp;
Robert-Louis-Stev&rsquo;ns&rsquo;n.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Commissary</span>
(<i>aghast</i>).&nbsp; <i>H&eacute;</i>!&nbsp; <i>Quoi</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Arethusa</span> (<i>perceiving and
improving his advantage</i>).&nbsp;
Rob&rsquo;rt-Lou&rsquo;s-Stev&rsquo;ns&rsquo;n.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Commissary</span> (<i>after several
conflicts with his pen</i>).&nbsp; <i>Eh bien</i>, <i>il faut se
passer du nom</i>.&nbsp; <i>Ca ne s&rsquo;&eacute;crit
pas</i>.&nbsp; (Well, we must do without the name: it is
unspellable.)</p>
<p>The above is a rough summary of this momentous conversation,
in which I have been chiefly careful to preserve the plums of the
Commissary; but the remainder of the scene, perhaps because of
his rising anger, has left but little definite in the memory of
the Arethusa.&nbsp; The Commissary was not, I think, a practised
literary man; no sooner, at least, had he taken pen in hand and
embarked on the composition of the <i>proc&egrave;s-verbal</i>,
than he became distinctly more uncivil and began to show a
predilection for that simplest of all forms of repartee:
&ldquo;You lie!&rdquo;&nbsp; Several times the Arethusa let it
pass, and then suddenly flared up, refused to accept more insults
or to answer further questions, defied the Commissary to do his
worst, and promised him, if he did, that he should bitterly
repent it.&nbsp; Perhaps if he had worn this proud front from the
first, instead of beginning with a sense of entertainment and
then going on to argue, the thing might have turned otherwise;
for even at this eleventh hour the Commissary was visibly
staggered.&nbsp; But it was too late; he had been challenged the
<i>proc&egrave;s-verbal</i> was begun; and he again squared his
elbows over his writing, and the Arethusa was led forth a
prisoner.</p>
<p>A step or two down the hot road stood the gendarmerie.&nbsp;
Thither was our unfortunate conducted, and there he was bidden to
empty forth the contents of his pockets.&nbsp; A handkerchief, a
pen, a pencil, a pipe and tobacco, matches, and some ten francs
of change: that was all.&nbsp; Not a file, not a cipher, not a
scrap of writing whether to identify or to condemn.&nbsp; The
very gendarme was appalled before such destitution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I arrested you,
for I see that you are no <i>voyou</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he
promised him every indulgence.</p>
<p>The Arethusa, thus encouraged, asked for his pipe.&nbsp; That
he was told was impossible, but if he chewed, he might have some
tobacco.&nbsp; He did not chew, however, and asked instead to
have his handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Non</i>,&rdquo; said the gendarme.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Nous avons eu des histoires de gens qui se sont
pendus</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (No, we have had histories of people who
hanged themselves.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; cried the Arethusa.&nbsp; &ldquo;And is it
for that you refuse me my handkerchief?&nbsp; But see how much
more easily I could hang myself in my trousers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was struck by the novelty of the idea; but he stuck to
his colours, and only continued to repeat vague offers of
service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; said the Arethusa, &ldquo;be sure that
you arrest my comrade; he will follow me ere long on the same
road, and you can tell him by the sack upon his
shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This promised, the prisoner was led round into the back court
of the building, a cellar door was opened, he was motioned down
the stair, and bolts grated and chains clanged behind his
descending person.</p>
<p>The philosophic and still more the imaginative mind is apt to
suppose itself prepared for any mortal accident.&nbsp; Prison,
among other ills, was one that had been often faced by the
undaunted Arethusa.&nbsp; Even as he went down the stairs, he was
telling himself that here was a famous occasion for a roundel,
and that like the committed linnets of the tuneful cavalier, he
too would make his prison musical.&nbsp; I will tell the truth at
once: the roundel was never written, or it should be printed in
this place, to raise a smile.&nbsp; Two reasons interfered: the
first moral, the second physical.</p>
<p>It is one of the curiosities of human nature, that although
all men are liars, they can none of them bear to be told so of
themselves.&nbsp; To get and take the lie with equanimity is a
stretch beyond the stoic; and the Arethusa, who had been
surfeited upon that insult, was blazing inwardly with a white
heat of smothered wrath.&nbsp; But the physical had also its
part.&nbsp; The cellar in which he was confined was some feet
underground, and it was only lighted by an unglazed, narrow
aperture high up in the wall and smothered in the leaves of a
green vine.&nbsp; The walls were of naked masonry, the floor of
bare earth; by way of furniture there was an earthenware basin, a
water-jug, and a wooden bedstead with a blue-gray cloak for
bedding.&nbsp; To be taken from the hot air of a summer&rsquo;s
afternoon, the reverberation of the road and the stir of rapid
exercise, and plunged into the gloom and damp of this receptacle
for vagabonds, struck an instant chill upon the Arethusa&rsquo;s
blood.&nbsp; Now see in how small a matter a hardship may
consist: the floor was exceedingly uneven underfoot, with the
very spade-marks, I suppose, of the labourers who dug the
foundations of the barrack; and what with the poor twilight and
the irregular surface, walking was impossible.&nbsp; The caged
author resisted for a good while; but the chill of the place
struck deeper and deeper; and at length, with such reluctance as
you may fancy, he was driven to climb upon the bed and wrap
himself in the public covering.&nbsp; There, then, he lay upon
the verge of shivering, plunged in semi-darkness, wound in a
garment whose touch he dreaded like the plague, and (in a spirit
far removed from resignation) telling the roll of the insults he
had just received.&nbsp; These are not circumstances favourable
to the muse.</p>
<p>Meantime (to look at the upper surface where the sun was still
shining and the guns of sportsmen were still noisy through the
tufted plain) the Cigarette was drawing near at his more
philosophic pace.&nbsp; In those days of liberty and health he
was the constant partner of the Arethusa, and had ample
opportunity to share in that gentleman&rsquo;s disfavour with the
police.&nbsp; Many a bitter bowl had he partaken of with that
disastrous comrade.&nbsp; He was himself a man born to float
easily through life, his face and manner artfully recommending
him to all.&nbsp; There was but one suspicious circumstance he
could not carry off, and that was his companion.&nbsp; He will
not readily forget the Commissary in what is ironically called
the free town of Frankfort-on-the-Main; nor the Franco-Belgian
frontier; nor the inn at La F&egrave;re; last, but not least, he
is pretty certain to remember Ch&acirc;tillon-sur-Loire.</p>
<p>At the town entry, the gendarme culled him like a wayside
flower; and a moment later, two persons, in a high state of
surprise, were confronted in the Commissary&rsquo;s office.&nbsp;
For if the Cigarette was surprised to be arrested, the Commissary
was no less taken aback by the appearance and appointments of his
captive.&nbsp; Here was a man about whom there could be no
mistake: a man of an unquestionable and unassailable manner, in
apple-pie order, dressed not with neatness merely but elegance,
ready with his passport, at a word, and well supplied with money:
a man the Commissary would have doffed his hat to on chance upon
the highway; and this <i>beau cavalier</i> unblushingly claimed
the Arethusa for his comrade!&nbsp; The conclusion of the
interview was foregone; of its humours, I remember only
one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Baronet?&rdquo; demanded the magistrate,
glancing up from the passport.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Alors</i>,
<i>monsieur</i>, <i>vous &ecirc;tes le firs d&rsquo;un
baron</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; And when the Cigarette (his one mistake
throughout the interview) denied the soft impeachment,
&ldquo;<i>Alors</i>,&rdquo; from the Commissary, &ldquo;<i>ce
n&rsquo;est pas votre passeport</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; But these were
ineffectual thunders; he never dreamed of laying hands upon the
Cigarette; presently he fell into a mood of unrestrained
admiration, gloating over the contents of the knapsack,
commanding our friend&rsquo;s tailor.&nbsp; Ah, what an honoured
guest was the Commissary entertaining! what suitable clothes he
wore for the warm weather! what beautiful maps, what an
attractive work of history he carried in his knapsack!&nbsp; You
are to understand there was now but one point of difference
between them: what was to be done with the Arethusa? the
Cigarette demanding his release, the Commissary still claiming
him as the dungeon&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; Now it chanced that the
Cigarette had passed some years of his life in Egypt, where he
had made acquaintance with two very bad things, cholera morbus
and pashas; and in the eye of the Commissary, as he fingered the
volume of Michelet, it seemed to our traveller there was
something Turkish.&nbsp; I pass over this lightly; it is highly
possible there was some misunderstanding, highly possible that
the Commissary (charmed with his visitor) supposed the attraction
to be mutual and took for an act of growing friendship what the
Cigarette himself regarded as a bribe.&nbsp; And at any rate, was
there ever a bribe more singular than an odd volume of
Michelet&rsquo;s history?&nbsp; The work was promised him for the
morrow, before our departure; and presently after, either because
he had his price, or to show that he was not the man to be behind
in friendly offices&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Eh bien</i>,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;<i>je suppose qu&rsquo;il faut l&acirc;her voire
camarade</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he tore up that feast of humour,
the unfinished <i>proc&egrave;s-verbal</i>.&nbsp; Ah, if he had
only torn up instead the Arethusa&rsquo;s roundels!&nbsp; There
were many works burnt at Alexandria, there are many treasured in
the British Museum, that I could better spare than the
<i>proc&egrave;s-verbal</i> of Ch&acirc;tillon.&nbsp; Poor
bubuckled Commissary!&nbsp; I begin to be sorry that he never had
his Michelet: perceiving in him fine human traits, a broad-based
stupidity, a gusto in his magisterial functions, a taste for
letters, a ready admiration for the admirable.&nbsp; And if he
did not admire the Arethusa, he was not alone in that.</p>
<p>To the imprisoned one, shivering under the public covering,
there came suddenly a noise of bolts and chains.&nbsp; He sprang
to his feet, ready to welcome a companion in calamity; and
instead of that, the door was flung wide, the friendly gendarme
appeared above in the strong daylight, and with a magnificent
gesture (being probably a student of the
drama)&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Vous &ecirc;tes libre</i>!&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; None too soon for the Arethusa.&nbsp; I doubt if he
had been half-an-hour imprisoned; but by the watch in a
man&rsquo;s brain (which was the only watch he carried) he should
have been eight times longer; and he passed forth with ecstasy up
the cellar stairs into the healing warmth of the afternoon sun;
and the breath of the earth came as sweet as a cow&rsquo;s into
his nostril; and he heard again (and could have laughed for
pleasure) the concord of delicate noises that we call the hum of
life.</p>
<p>And here it might be thought that my history ended; but not
so, this was an act-drop and not the curtain.&nbsp; Upon what
followed in front of the barrack, since there was a lady in the
case, I scruple to expatiate.&nbsp; The wife of the
Mar&eacute;chal-des-logis was a handsome woman, and yet the
Arethusa was not sorry to be gone from her society.&nbsp;
Something of her image, cool as a peach on that hot afternoon,
still lingers in his memory: yet more of her conversation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have there a very fine parlour,&rdquo; said the poor
gentleman.&mdash;&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Madame la
Mar&eacute;chale (des-logis), &ldquo;you are very well acquainted
with such parlours!&rdquo;&nbsp; And you should have seen with
what a hard and scornful eye she measured the vagabond before
her!&nbsp; I do not think he ever hated the Commissary; but
before that interview was at an end, he hated Madame la
Mar&eacute;chale.&nbsp; His passion (as I am led to understand by
one who was present) stood confessed in a burning eye, a pale
cheek, and a trembling utterance; Madame meanwhile tasting the
joys of the matador, goading him with barbed words and staring
him coldly down.</p>
<p>It was certainly good to be away from this lady, and better
still to sit down to an excellent dinner in the inn.&nbsp; Here,
too, the despised travellers scraped acquaintance with their next
neighbour, a gentleman of these parts, returned from the
day&rsquo;s sport, who had the good taste to find pleasure in
their society.&nbsp; The dinner at an end, the gentleman proposed
the acquaintance should be ripened in the caf&eacute;.</p>
<p>The caf&eacute; was crowded with sportsmen conclamantly
explaining to each other and the world the smallness of their
bags.&nbsp; About the centre of the room, the Cigarette and the
Arethusa sat with their new acquaintance; a trio very well
pleased, for the travellers (after their late experience) were
greedy of consideration, and their sportsman rejoiced in a pair
of patient listeners.&nbsp; Suddenly the glass door flew open
with a crash; the Mar&eacute;chal-des-logis appeared in the
interval, gorgeously belted and befrogged, entered without
salutation, strode up the room with a clang of spurs and weapons,
and disappeared through a door at the far end.&nbsp; Close at his
heels followed the Arethusa&rsquo;s gendarme of the afternoon,
imitating, with a nice shade of difference, the imperial bearing
of his chief; only, as he passed, he struck lightly with his open
hand on the shoulder of his late captive, and with that ringing,
dramatic utterance of which he had the
secret&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Suivez</i>!&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>The arrest of the members, the oath of the Tennis Court, the
signing of the declaration of independence, Mark Antony&rsquo;s
oration, all the brave scenes of history, I conceive as having
been not unlike that evening in the caf&eacute; at
Ch&acirc;tillon.&nbsp; Terror breathed upon the assembly.&nbsp; A
moment later, when the Arethusa had followed his recaptors into
the farther part of the house, the Cigarette found himself alone
with his coffee in a ring of empty chairs and tables, all the
lusty sportsmen huddled into corners, all their clamorous voices
hushed in whispering, all their eyes shooting at him furtively as
at a leper.</p>
<p>And the Arethusa?&nbsp; Well, he had a long, sometimes a
trying, interview in the back kitchen.&nbsp; The
Mar&eacute;chal-des-logis, who was a very handsome man, and I
believe both intelligent and honest, had no clear opinion on the
case.&nbsp; He thought the Commissary had done wrong, but he did
not wish to get his subordinates into trouble; and he proposed
this, that, and the other, to all of which the Arethusa (with a
growing sense of his position) demurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short,&rdquo; suggested the Arethusa, &ldquo;you
want to wash your hands of further responsibility?&nbsp; Well,
then, let me go to Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mar&eacute;chal-des-logis looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may leave,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;by the ten
o&rsquo;clock train for Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at noon the next day the travellers were telling their
misadventure in the dining-room at Siron&rsquo;s.</p>

RANDOM MEMORIES</h2>
<h3>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Coast of Fife</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> writers have vigorously
described the pains of the first day or the first night at
school; to a boy of any enterprise, I believe, they are more
often agreeably exciting.&nbsp; Misery&mdash;or at least misery
unrelieved&mdash;is confined to another period, to the days of
suspense and the &ldquo;dreadful looking-for&rdquo; of departure;
when the old life is running to an end, and the new life, with
its new interests, not yet begun: and to the pain of an imminent
parting, there is added the unrest of a state of conscious
pre-existence.&nbsp; The area railings, the beloved shop-window,
the smell of semi-suburban tanpits, the song of the church bells
upon a Sunday, the thin, high voices of compatriot children in a
playing-field&mdash;what a sudden, what an overpowering pathos
breathes to him from each familiar circumstance!&nbsp; The
assaults of sorrow come not from within, as it seems to him, but
from without.&nbsp; I was proud and glad to go to school; had I
been let alone, I could have borne up like any hero; but there
was around me, in all my native town, a conspiracy of
lamentation: &ldquo;Poor little boy, he is going
away&mdash;unkind little boy, he is going to leave us&rdquo;; so
the unspoken burthen followed me as I went, with yearning and
reproach.&nbsp; And at length, one melancholy afternoon in the
early autumn, and at a place where it seems to me, looking back,
it must be always autumn and generally Sunday, there came
suddenly upon the face of all I saw&mdash;the long empty road,
the lines of the tall houses, the church upon the hill, the woody
hillside garden&mdash;a look of such a piercing sadness that my
heart died; and seating myself on a door-step, I shed tears of
miserable sympathy.&nbsp; A benevolent cat cumbered me the while
with consolations&mdash;we two were alone in all that was visible
of the London Road: two poor waifs who had each tasted
sorrow&mdash;and she fawned upon the weeper, and gambolled for
his entertainment, watching the effect it seemed, with motherly
eyes.</p>
<p>For the sake of the cat, God bless her!&nbsp; I confessed at
home the story of my weakness; and so it comes about that I owed
a certain journey, and the reader owes the present paper, to a
cat in the London Road.&nbsp; It was judged, if I had thus
brimmed over on the public highway, some change of scene was (in
the medical sense) indicated; my father at the time was visiting
the harbour lights of Scotland; and it was decided he should take
me along with him around a portion of the shores of Fife; my
first professional tour, my first journey in the complete
character of man, without the help of petticoats.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Fife (that royal province) may be observed by
the curious on the map, occupying a tongue of land between the
firths of Forth and Tay.&nbsp; It may be continually seen from
many parts of Edinburgh (among the rest, from the windows of my
father&rsquo;s house) dying away into the distance and the
easterly <i>haar</i> with one smoky seaside town beyond another,
or in winter printing on the gray heaven some glittering
hill-tops.&nbsp; It has no beauty to recommend it, being a low,
sea-salted, wind-vexed promontory; trees very rare, except (as
common on the east coast) along the dens of rivers; the fields
well cultivated, I understand, but not lovely to the eye.&nbsp;
It is of the coast I speak: the interior may be the garden of
Eden.&nbsp; History broods over that part of the world like the
easterly <i>haar</i>.&nbsp; Even on the map, its long row of
Gaelic place-names bear testimony to an old and settled
race.&nbsp; Of these little towns, posted along the shore as
close as sedges, each with its bit of harbour, its old
weather-beaten church or public building, its flavour of decayed
prosperity and decaying fish, not one but has its legend, quaint
or tragic: Dunfermline, in whose royal towers the king may be
still observed (in the ballad) drinking the blood-red wine;
somnolent Inverkeithing, once the quarantine of Leith; Aberdour,
hard by the monastic islet of Inchcolm, hard by Donibristle where
the &ldquo;bonny face was spoiled&rdquo;; Burntisland where, when
Paul Jones was off the coast, the Reverend Mr. Shirra had a table
carried between tidemarks, and publicly prayed against the rover
at the pitch of his voice and his broad lowland dialect;
Kinghorn, where Alexander &ldquo;brak&rsquo;s neckbane&rdquo; and
left Scotland to the English wars; Kirkcaldy, where the witches
once prevailed extremely and sank tall ships and honest mariners
in the North Sea; Dysart, famous&mdash;well famous at least to me
for the Dutch ships that lay in its harbour, painted like toys
and with pots of flowers and cages of song-birds in the cabin
windows, and for one particular Dutch skipper who would sit all
day in slippers on the break of the poop, smoking a long German
pipe; Wemyss (pronounce Weems) with its bat-haunted caves, where
the Chevalier Johnstone, on his flight from Culloden, passed a
night of superstitious terrors; Leven, a bald, quite modern
place, sacred to summer visitors, whence there has gone but
yesterday the tall figure and the white locks of the last
Englishman in Delhi, my uncle Dr. Balfour, who was still walking
his hospital rounds, while the troopers from Meerut clattered and
cried &ldquo;Deen Deen&rdquo; along the streets of the imperial
city, and Willoughby mustered his handful of heroes at the
magazine, and the nameless brave one in the telegraph office was
perhaps already fingering his last despatch; and just a little
beyond Leven, Largo Law and the smoke of Largo town mounting
about its feet, the town of Alexander Selkirk, better known under
the name of Robinson Crusoe.&nbsp; So on, the list might be
pursued (only for private reasons, which the reader will shortly
have an opportunity to guess) by St. Monance, and Pittenweem, and
the two Anstruthers, and Cellardyke, and Crail, where Primate
Sharpe was once a humble and innocent country minister: on to the
heel of the land, to Fife Ness, overlooked by a sea-wood of
matted elders and the quaint old mansion of Balcomie, itself
overlooking but the breach or the quiescence of the
deep&mdash;the Carr Rock beacon rising close in front, and as
night draws in, the star of the Inchcape reef springing up on the
one hand, and the star of the May Island on the other, and
farther off yet a third and a greater on the craggy foreland of
St. Abb&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And but a little way round the corner of
the land, imminent itself above the sea, stands the gem of the
province and the light of medi&aelig;val Scotland, St. Andrews,
where the great Cardinal Beaton held garrison against the world,
and the second of the name and title perished (as you may read in
Knox&rsquo;s jeering narrative) under the knives of true-blue
Protestants, and to this day (after so many centuries) the
current voice of the professor is not hushed.</p>
<p>Here it was that my first tour of inspection began, early on a
bleak easterly morning.&nbsp; There was a crashing run of sea
upon the shore, I recollect, and my father and the man of the
harbour light must sometimes raise their voices to be
audible.&nbsp; Perhaps it is from this circumstance, that I
always imagine St. Andrews to be an ineffectual seat of learning,
and the sound of the east wind and the bursting surf to linger in
its drowsy classrooms and confound the utterance of the
professor, until teacher and taught are alike drowned in
oblivion, and only the sea-gull beats on the windows and the
draught of the sea-air rustles in the pages of the open
lecture.&nbsp; But upon all this, and the romance of St. Andrews
in general, the reader must consult the works of Mr. Andrew Lang;
who has written of it but the other day in his dainty prose and
with his incommunicable humour, and long ago in one of his best
poems, with grace, and local truth, and a note of unaffected
pathos.&nbsp; Mr. Lang knows all about the romance, I say, and
the educational advantages, but I doubt if he had turned his
attention to the harbour lights; and it may be news even to him,
that in the year 1863 their case was pitiable.&nbsp; Hanging
about with the east wind humming in my teeth, and my hands (I
make no doubt) in my pockets, I looked for the first time upon
that tragi-comedy of the visiting engineer which I have seen so
often re-enacted on a more important stage.&nbsp; Eighty years
ago, I find my grandfather writing: &ldquo;It is the most painful
thing that can occur to me to have a correspondence of this kind
with any of the keepers, and when I come to the Light House,
instead of having the satisfaction to meet them with approbation
and welcome their Family, it is distressing when one-is obliged
to put on a most angry countenance and demeanour.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This painful obligation has been hereditary in my race.&nbsp; I
have myself, on a perfectly amateur and unauthorised inspection
of Turnberry Point, bent my brows upon the keeper on the question
of storm-panes; and felt a keen pang of self-reproach, when we
went down stairs again and I found he was making a coffin for his
infant child; and then regained my equanimity with the thought
that I had done the man a service, and when the proper inspector
came, he would be readier with his panes.&nbsp; The human race is
perhaps credited with more duplicity than it deserves.&nbsp; The
visitation of a lighthouse at least is a business of the most
transparent nature.&nbsp; As soon as the boat grates on the
shore, and the keepers step forward in their uniformed coats, the
very slouch of the fellows&rsquo; shoulders tells their story,
and the engineer may begin at once to assume his &ldquo;angry
countenance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly the brass of the handrail
will be clouded; and if the brass be not immaculate, certainly
all will be to match&mdash;the reflectors scratched, the spare
lamp unready, the storm-panes in the storehouse.&nbsp; If a light
is not rather more than middling good, it will be radically
bad.&nbsp; Mediocrity (except in literature) appears to be
unattainable by man.&nbsp; But of course the unfortunate of St.
Andrews was only an amateur, he was not in the Service, he had no
uniform coat, he was (I believe) a plumber by his trade and stood
(in the medi&aelig;val phrase) quite out of the danger of my
father; but he had a painful interview for all that, and
perspired extremely.</p>
<p>From St. Andrews, we drove over Magus Muir.&nbsp; My father
had announced we were &ldquo;to post,&rdquo; and the phrase
called up in my hopeful mind visions of top-boots and the
pictures in Rowlandson&rsquo;s <i>Dance of Death</i>; but it was
only a jingling cab that came to the inn door, such as I had
driven in a thousand times at the low price of one shilling on
the streets of Edinburgh.&nbsp; Beyond this disappointment, I
remember nothing of that drive.&nbsp; It is a road I have often
travelled, and of not one of these journeys do I remember any
single trait.&nbsp; The fact has not been suffered to encroach on
the truth of the imagination.&nbsp; I still see Magus Muir two
hundred years ago; a desert place, quite uninclosed; in the
midst, the primate&rsquo;s carriage fleeing at the gallop; the
assassins loose-reined in pursuit, Burley Balfour, pistol in
hand, among the first.&nbsp; No scene of history has ever written
itself so deeply on my mind; not because Balfour, that
questionable zealot, was an ancestral cousin of my own; not
because of the pleadings of the victim and his daughter; not even
because of the live bum-bee that flew out of Sharpe&rsquo;s
&rsquo;bacco-box, thus clearly indicating his complicity with
Satan; nor merely because, as it was after all a crime of a fine
religious flavour, it figured in Sunday books and afforded a
grateful relief from <i>Ministering Children</i> or the
<i>Memoirs of Mrs. Kathatine Winslowe</i>.&nbsp; The figure that
always fixed my attention is that of Hackston of Rathillet,
sitting in the saddle with his cloak about his mouth, and through
all that long, bungling, vociferous hurly-burly, revolving
privately a case of conscience.&nbsp; He would take no hand in
the deed, because he had a private spite against the victim, and
&ldquo;that action&rdquo; must be sullied with no suggestion of a
worldly motive; on the other hand, &ldquo;that action,&rdquo; in
itself, was highly justified, he had cast in his lot with
&ldquo;the actors,&rdquo; and he must stay there, inactive but
publicly sharing the responsibility.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a
gentleman&mdash;you will protect me!&rdquo; cried the wounded old
man, crawling towards him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will never lay a hand
on you,&rdquo; said Hackston, and put his cloak about his
mouth.&nbsp; It is an old temptation with me, to pluck away that
cloak and see the face&mdash;to open that bosom and to read the
heart.&nbsp; With incomplete romances about Hackston, the drawers
of my youth were lumbered.&nbsp; I read him up in every printed
book that I could lay my hands on.&nbsp; I even dug among the
Wodrow manuscripts, sitting shame-faced in the very room where my
hero had been tortured two centuries before, and keenly conscious
of my youth in the midst of other and (as I fondly thought) more
gifted students.&nbsp; All was vain: that he had passed a riotous
nonage, that he was a zealot, that he twice displayed (compared
with his grotesque companions) some tincture of soldierly
resolution and even of military common sense, and that he figured
memorably in the scene on Magus Muir, so much and no more could I
make out.&nbsp; But whenever I cast my eyes backward, it is to
see him like a landmark on the plains of history, sitting with
his cloak about his mouth, inscrutable.&nbsp; How small a thing
creates an immortality!&nbsp; I do not think he can have been a
man entirely commonplace; but had he not thrown his cloak about
his mouth, or had the witnesses forgot to chronicle the action,
he would not thus have haunted the imagination of my boyhood, and
to-day he would scarce delay me for a paragraph.&nbsp; An
incident, at once romantic and dramatic, which at once awakes the
judgment and makes a picture for the eye, how little do we
realise its perdurable power!&nbsp; Perhaps no one does so but
the author, just as none but he appreciates the influence of
jingling words; so that he looks on upon life, with something of
a covert smile, seeing people led by what they fancy to be
thoughts and what are really the accustomed artifices of his own
trade, or roused by what they take to be principles and are
really picturesque effects.&nbsp; In a pleasant book about a
school-class club, Colonel Fergusson has recently told a little
anecdote.&nbsp; A &ldquo;Philosophical Society&rdquo; was formed
by some Academy boys&mdash;among them, Colonel Fergusson himself,
Fleeming Jenkin, and Andrew Wilson, the Christian Buddhist and
author of <i>The Abode of Snow</i>.&nbsp; Before these learned
pundits, one member laid the following ingenious problem:
&ldquo;What would be the result of putting a pound of potassium
in a pot of porter?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I should think there
would be a number of interesting bi-products,&rdquo; said a
smatterer at my elbow; but for me the tale itself has a
bi-product, and stands as a type of much that is most
human.&nbsp; For this inquirer who conceived himself to burn with
a zeal entirely chemical, was really immersed in a design of a
quite different nature; unconsciously to his own recently
breeched intelligence, he was engaged in literature.&nbsp;
Putting, pound, potassium, pot, porter; initial p, mediant
t&mdash;that was his idea, poor little boy!&nbsp; So with
politics and that which excites men in the present, so with
history and that which rouses them in the past: there lie at the
root of what appears, most serious unsuspected elements.</p>
<p>The triple town of Anstruther Wester, Anstruther Easter, and
Cellardyke, all three Royal Burghs&mdash;or two Royal Burghs and
a less distinguished suburb, I forget which&mdash;lies
continuously along the seaside, and boasts of either two or three
separate parish churches, and either two or three separate
harbours.&nbsp; These ambiguities are painful; but the fact is
(although it argue me uncultured), I am but poorly posted upon
Cellardyke.&nbsp; My business lay in the two Anstruthers.&nbsp; A
tricklet of a stream divides them, spanned by a bridge; and over
the bridge at the time of my knowledge, the celebrated Shell
House stood outpost on the west.&nbsp; This had been the
residence of an agreeable eccentric; during his fond tenancy, he
had illustrated the outer walls, as high (if I remember rightly)
as the roof, with elaborate patterns and pictures, and snatches
of verse in the vein of <i>exegi monumentum</i>; shells and
pebbles, artfully contrasted and conjoined, had been his medium;
and I like to think of him standing back upon the bridge, when
all was finished, drinking in the general effect and (like
Gibbon) already lamenting his employment.</p>
<p>The same bridge saw another sight in the seventeenth
century.&nbsp; Mr. Thomson, the &ldquo;curat&rdquo; of Anstruther
Easter, was a man highly obnoxious to the devout: in the first
place, because he was a &ldquo;curat&rdquo;; in the second place,
because he was a person of irregular and scandalous life; and in
the third place, because he was generally suspected of dealings
with the Enemy of Man.&nbsp; These three disqualifications, in
the popular literature of the time, go hand in hand; but the end
of Mr. Thomson was a thing quite by itself, and in the proper
phrase, a manifest judgment.&nbsp; He had been at a
friend&rsquo;s house in Anstruther Wester, where (and elsewhere,
I suspect) he had partaken of the bottle; indeed, to put the
thing in our cold modern way, the reverend gentleman was on the
brink of <i>delirium tremens</i>.&nbsp; It was a dark night, it
seems; a little lassie came carrying a lantern to fetch the
curate home; and away they went down the street of Anstruther
Wester, the lantern swinging a bit in the child&rsquo;s hand, the
barred lustre tossing up and down along the front of slumbering
houses, and Mr. Thomson not altogether steady on his legs nor (to
all appearance) easy in his mind.&nbsp; The pair had reached the
middle of the bridge when (as I conceive the scene) the poor
tippler started in some baseless fear and looked behind him; the
child, already shaken by the minister&rsquo;s strange behaviour,
started also; in so doing, she would jerk the lantern; and for
the space of a moment the lights and the shadows would be all
confounded.&nbsp; Then it was that to the unhinged toper and the
twittering child, a huge bulk of blackness seemed to sweep down,
to pass them close by as they stood upon the bridge, and to
vanish on the farther side in the general darkness of the
night.&nbsp; &ldquo;Plainly the devil come for Mr.
Thomson!&rdquo; thought the child.&nbsp; What Mr. Thomson thought
himself, we have no ground of knowledge; but he fell upon his
knees in the midst of the bridge like a man praying.&nbsp; On the
rest of the journey to the manse, history is silent; but when
they came to the door, the poor caitiff, taking the lantern from
the child, looked upon her with so lost a countenance that her
little courage died within her, and she fled home screaming to
her parents.&nbsp; Not a soul would venture out; all that night,
the minister dwelt alone with his terrors in the manse; and when
the day dawned, and men made bold to go about the streets, they
found the devil had come indeed for Mr. Thomson.</p>
<p>This manse of Anstruther Easter has another and a more
cheerful association.&nbsp; It was early in the morning, about a
century before the days of Mr. Thomson, that his predecessor was
called out of bed to welcome a Grandee of Spain, the Duke of
Medina Sidonia, just landed in the harbour underneath.&nbsp; But
sure there was never seen a more decayed grandee; sure there was
never a duke welcomed from a stranger place of exile.&nbsp;
Half-way between Orkney and Shetland, there lies a certain isle;
on the one hand the Atlantic, on the other the North Sea, bombard
its pillared cliffs; sore-eyed, short-living, inbred fishers and
their families herd in its few huts; in the graveyard pieces of
wreck-wood stand for monuments; there is nowhere a more
inhospitable spot.&nbsp;
<i>Belle-Isle-en-Mer</i>&mdash;Fair-Isle-at-Sea&mdash;that is a
name that has always rung in my mind&rsquo;s ear like music; but
the only &ldquo;Fair Isle&rdquo; on which I ever set my foot, was
this unhomely, rugged turret-top of submarine sierras.&nbsp;
Here, when his ship was broken, my lord Duke joyfully got ashore;
here for long months he and certain of his men were harboured;
and it was from this durance that he landed at last to be
welcomed (as well as such a papist deserved, no doubt) by the
godly incumbent of Anstruther Easter; and after the Fair Isle,
what a fine city must that have appeared! and after the island
diet, what a hospitable spot the minister&rsquo;s table!&nbsp;
And yet he must have lived on friendly terms with his outlandish
hosts.&nbsp; For to this day there still survives a relic of the
long winter evenings when the sailors of the great Armada
crouched about the hearths of the Fair-Islanders, the planks of
their own lost galleon perhaps lighting up the scene, and the
gale and the surf that beat about the coast contributing their
melancholy voices.&nbsp; All the folk of the north isles are
great artificers of knitting: the Fair-Islanders alone dye their
fabrics in the Spanish manner.&nbsp; To this day, gloves and
nightcaps, innocently decorated, may be seen for sale in the
Shetland warehouse at Edinburgh, or on the Fair Isle itself in
the catechist&rsquo;s house; and to this day, they tell the story
of the Duke of Medina Sidonia&rsquo;s adventure.</p>
<p>It would seem as if the Fair Isle had some attraction for
&ldquo;persons of quality.&rdquo;&nbsp; When I landed there
myself, an elderly gentleman, unshaved, poorly attired, his
shoulders wrapped in a plaid, was seen walking to and fro, with a
book in his hand, upon the beach.&nbsp; He paid no heed to our
arrival, which we thought a strange thing in itself; but when one
of the officers of the <i>Pharos</i>, passing narrowly by him,
observed his book to be a Greek Testament, our wonder and
interest took a higher flight.&nbsp; The catechist was
cross-examined; he said the gentleman had been put across some
time before in Mr. Bruce of Sumburgh&rsquo;s schooner, the only
link between the Fair Isle and the rest of the world; and that he
held services and was doing &ldquo;good.&rdquo;&nbsp; So much
came glibly enough; but when pressed a little farther, the
catechist displayed embarrassment.&nbsp; A singular diffidence
appeared upon his face: &ldquo;They tell me,&rdquo; said he, in
low tones, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;s a lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; And a lord
he was; a peer of the realm pacing that inhospitable beach with
his Greek Testament, and his plaid about his shoulders, set upon
doing good, as he understood it, worthy man!&nbsp; And his
grandson, a good-looking little boy, much better dressed than the
lordly evangelist, and speaking with a silken English accent very
foreign to the scene, accompanied me for a while in my
exploration of the island.&nbsp; I suppose this little fellow is
now my lord, and wonder how much he remembers of the Fair
Isle.&nbsp; Perhaps not much; for he seemed to accept very
quietly his savage situation; and under such guidance, it is like
that this was not his first nor yet his last adventure.</p>

RANDOM MEMORIES</h2>
<h3>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Education of an
Engineer</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Anstruther</span> is a place sacred to the
Muse; she inspired (really to a considerable extent)
Tennant&rsquo;s vernacular poem <i>Anst&rsquo;er Fair</i>; and I
have there waited upon her myself with much devotion.&nbsp; This
was when I came as a young man to glean engineering experience
from the building of the breakwater.&nbsp; What I gleaned, I am
sure I do not know; but indeed I had already my own private
determination to be an author; I loved the art of words and the
appearances of life; and <i>travellers</i>, and <i>headers</i>,
and <i>rubble</i>, and <i>polished ashlar</i>, and <i>pierres
perdues</i>, and even the thrilling question of the
<i>string-course</i>, interested me only (if they interested me
at all) as properties for some possible romance or as words to
add to my vocabulary.&nbsp; To grow a little catholic is the
compensation of years; youth is one-eyed; and in those days,
though I haunted the breakwater by day, and even loved the place
for the sake of the sunshine, the thrilling seaside air, the wash
of waves on the sea-face, the green glimmer of the divers&rsquo;
helmets far below, and the musical chinking of the masons, my one
genuine preoccupation lay elsewhere, and my only industry was in
the hours when I was not on duty.&nbsp; I lodged with a certain
Bailie Brown, a carpenter by trade; and there, as soon as dinner
was despatched, in a chamber scented with dry rose-leaves, drew
in my chair to the table and proceeded to pour forth literature,
at such a speed, and with such intimations of early death and
immortality, as I now look back upon with wonder.&nbsp; Then it
was that I wrote <i>Voces Fidelium</i>, a series of dramatic
monologues in verse; then that I indited the bulk of a
covenanting novel&mdash;like so many others, never
finished.&nbsp; Late I sat into the night, toiling (as I thought)
under the very dart of death, toiling to leave a memory behind
me.&nbsp; I feel moved to thrust aside the curtain of the years,
to hail that poor feverish idiot, to bid him go to bed and clap
<i>Voces Fidelium</i> on the fire before he goes; so clear does
he appear before me, sitting there between his candles in the
rose-scented room and the late night; so ridiculous a picture (to
my elderly wisdom) does the fool present!&nbsp; But he was driven
to his bed at last without miraculous intervention; and the
manner of his driving sets the last touch upon this eminently
youthful business.&nbsp; The weather was then so warm that I must
keep the windows open; the night without was populous with
moths.&nbsp; As the late darkness deepened, my literary tapers
beaconed forth more brightly; thicker and thicker came the dusty
night-fliers, to gyrate for one brilliant instant round the flame
and fall in agonies upon my paper.&nbsp; Flesh and blood could
not endure the spectacle; to capture immortality was doubtless a
noble enterprise, but not to capture it at such a cost of
suffering; and out would go the candles, and off would I go to
bed in the darkness raging to think that the blow might fall on
the morrow, and there was <i>Voces Fidelium</i> still
incomplete.&nbsp; Well, the moths are&mdash;all gone, and
<i>Voces Fidelium</i> along with them; only the fool is still on
hand and practises new follies.</p>
<p>Only one thing in connection with the harbour tempted me, and
that was the diving, an experience I burned to taste of.&nbsp;
But this was not to be, at least in Anstruther; and the subject
involves a change of scene to the sub-arctic town of Wick.&nbsp;
You can never have dwelt in a country more unsightly than that
part of Caithness, the land faintly swelling, faintly falling,
not a tree, not a hedgerow, the fields divided by single slate
stones set upon their edge, the wind always singing in your ears
and (down the long road that led nowhere) thrumming in the
telegraph wires.&nbsp; Only as you approached the coast was there
anything to stir the heart.&nbsp; The plateau broke down to the
North Sea in formidable cliffs, the tall out-stacks rose like
pillars ringed about with surf, the coves were over-brimmed with
clamorous froth, the sea-birds screamed, the wind sang in the
thyme on the cliff&rsquo;s edge; here and there, small ancient
castles toppled on the brim; here and there, it was possible to
dip into a dell of shelter, where you might lie and tell yourself
you were a little warm, and hear (near at hand) the whin-pods
bursting in the afternoon sun, and (farther off) the rumour of
the turbulent sea.&nbsp; As for Wick itself, it is one of the
meanest of man&rsquo;s towns, and situate certainly on the
baldest of God&rsquo;s bays.&nbsp; It lives for herring, and a
strange sight it is to see (of an afternoon) the heights of
Pulteney blackened by seaward-looking fishers, as when a city
crowds to a review&mdash;or, as when bees have swarmed, the
ground is horrible with lumps and clusters; and a strange sight,
and a beautiful, to see the fleet put silently out against a
rising moon, the sea-line rough as a wood with sails, and ever
and again and one after another, a boat flitting swiftly by the
silver disk.&nbsp; This mass of fishers, this great fleet of
boats, is out of all proportion to the town itself; and the oars
are manned and the nets hauled by immigrants from the Long Island
(as we call the outer Hebrides), who come for that season only,
and depart again, if &ldquo;the take&rdquo; be poor, leaving
debts behind them.&nbsp; In a bad year, the end of the herring
fishery is therefore an exciting time; fights are common, riots
often possible; an apple knocked from a child&rsquo;s hand was
once the signal for something like a war; and even when I was
there, a gunboat lay in the bay to assist the authorities.&nbsp;
To contrary interests, it should be observed, the curse of Babel
is here added; the Lews men are Gaelic speakers.&nbsp; Caithness
has adopted English; an odd circumstance, if you reflect that
both must be largely Norsemen by descent.&nbsp; I remember seeing
one of the strongest instances of this division: a thing like a
Punch-and-Judy box erected on the flat grave-stones of the
churchyard; from the hutch or proscenium&mdash;I know not what to
call it&mdash;an eldritch-looking preacher laying down the law in
Gaelic about some one of the name of <i>Powl</i>, whom I at last
divined to be the apostle to the Gentiles; a large congregation
of the Lews men very devoutly listening; and on the outskirts of
the crowd, some of the town&rsquo;s children (to whom the whole
affair was Greek and Hebrew) profanely playing tigg.&nbsp; The
same descent, the same country, the same narrow sect of the same
religion, and all these bonds made very largely nugatory by an
accidental difference of dialect!</p>
<p>Into the bay of Wick stretched the dark length of the
unfinished breakwater, in its cage of open staging; the
travellers (like frames of churches) over-plumbing all; and away
at the extreme end, the divers toiling unseen on the
foundation.&nbsp; On a platform of loose planks, the assistants
turned their air-mills; a stone might be swinging between wind
and water; underneath the swell ran gaily; and from time to time,
a mailed dragon with a window-glass snout came dripping up the
ladder.&nbsp; Youth is a blessed season after all; my stay at
Wick was in the year of <i>Voces Fidelium</i> and the rose-leaf
room at Bailie Brown&rsquo;s; and already I did not care two
straws for literary glory.&nbsp; Posthumous ambition perhaps
requires an atmosphere of roses; and the more rugged excitant of
Wick east winds had made another boy of me.&nbsp; To go down in
the diving-dress, that was my absorbing fancy; and with the
countenance of a certain handsome scamp of a diver, Bob Bain by
name, I gratified the whim.</p>
<p>It was gray, harsh, easterly weather, the swell ran pretty
high, and out in the open there were &ldquo;skipper&rsquo;s
daughters,&rdquo; when I found myself at last on the
diver&rsquo;s platform, twenty pounds of lead upon each foot and
my whole person swollen with ply and ply of woollen
underclothing.&nbsp; One moment, the salt wind was whistling
round my night-capped head; the next, I was crushed almost double
under the weight of the helmet.&nbsp; As that intolerable
burthern was laid upon me, I could have found it in my heart
(only for shame&rsquo;s sake) to cry off from the whole
enterprise.&nbsp; But it was too late.&nbsp; The attendants began
to turn the hurdy-gurdy, and the air to whistle through the tube;
some one screwed in the barred window of the vizor; and I was cut
off in a moment from my fellow-men; standing there in their
midst, but quite divorced from intercourse: a creature deaf and
dumb, pathetically looking forth upon them from a climate of his
own.&nbsp; Except that I could move and feel, I was like a man
fallen in a catalepsy.&nbsp; But time was scarce given me to
realise my isolation; the weights were hung upon my back and
breast, the signal rope was thrust into my unresisting hand; and
setting a twenty-pound foot upon the ladder, I began ponderously
to descend.</p>
<p>Some twenty rounds below the platform, twilight fell.&nbsp;
Looking up, I saw a low green heaven mottled with vanishing bells
of white; looking around, except for the weedy spokes and shafts
of the ladder, nothing but a green gloaming, somewhat opaque but
very restful and delicious.&nbsp; Thirty rounds lower, I stepped
off on the <i>pierres perdues</i> of the foundation; a dumb
helmeted figure took me by the hand, and made a gesture (as I
read it) of encouragement; and looking in at the creature&rsquo;s
window, I beheld the face of Bain.&nbsp; There we were, hand to
hand and (when it pleased us) eye to eye; and either might have
burst himself with shouting, and not a whisper come to his
companion&rsquo;s hearing.&nbsp; Each, in his own little world of
air, stood incommunicably separate.</p>
<p>Bob had told me ere this a little tale, a five minutes&rsquo;
drama at the bottom of the sea, which at that moment possibly
shot across my mind.&nbsp; He was down with another, settling a
stone of the sea-wall.&nbsp; They had it well adjusted, Bob gave
the signal, the scissors were slipped, the stone set home; and it
was time to turn to something else.&nbsp; But still his companion
remained bowed over the block like a mourner on a tomb, or only
raised himself to make absurd contortions and mysterious signs
unknown to the vocabulary of the diver.&nbsp; There, then, these
two stood for awhile, like the dead and the living; till there
flashed a fortunate thought into Bob&rsquo;s mind, and he
stooped, peered through the window of that other world, and
beheld the face of its inhabitant wet with streaming tears.&nbsp;
Ah! the man was in pain!&nbsp; And Bob, glancing downward, saw
what was the trouble: the block had been lowered on the foot of
that unfortunate&mdash;he was caught alive at the bottom of the
sea under fifteen tons of rock.</p>
<p>That two men should handle a stone so heavy, even swinging in
the scissors, may appear strange to the inexpert.&nbsp; These
must bear in mind the great density of the water of the sea, and
the surprising results of transplantation to that medium.&nbsp;
To understand a little what these are, and how a man&rsquo;s
weight, so far from being an encumbrance, is the very ground of
his agility, was the chief lesson of my submarine
experience.&nbsp; The knowledge came upon me by degrees.&nbsp; As
I began to go forward with the hand of my estranged companion, a
world of tumbled stones was visible, pillared with the weedy
uprights of the staging: overhead, a flat roof of green: a little
in front, the sea-wall, like an unfinished rampart.&nbsp; And
presently in our upward progress, Bob motioned me to leap upon a
stone; I looked to see if he were possibly in earnest, and he
only signed to me the more imperiously.&nbsp; Now the block stood
six feet high; it would have been quite a leap to me
unencumbered; with the breast and back weights, and the twenty
pounds upon each foot, and the staggering load of the helmet, the
thing was out of reason.&nbsp; I laughed aloud in my tomb; and to
prove to Bob how far he was astray, I gave a little impulse from
my toes.&nbsp; Up I soared like a bird, my companion soaring at
my side.&nbsp; As high as to the stone, and then higher, I
pursued my impotent and empty flight.&nbsp; Even when the strong
arm of Bob had checked my shoulders, my heels continued their
ascent; so that I blew out sideways like an autumn leaf, and must
be hauled in, hand over hand, as sailors haul in the slack of a
sail, and propped upon my feet again like an intoxicated
sparrow.&nbsp; Yet a little higher on the foundation, and we
began to be affected by the bottom of the swell, running there
like a strong breeze of wind.&nbsp; Or so I must suppose; for,
safe in my cushion of air, I was conscious of no impact; only
swayed idly like a weed, and was now borne helplessly abroad, and
now swiftly&mdash;and yet with dream-like
gentleness&mdash;impelled against my guide.&nbsp; So does a
child&rsquo;s balloon divagate upon the currents of the air, and
touch, and slide off again from every obstacle.&nbsp; So must
have ineffectually swung, so resented their inefficiency, those
light crowds that followed the Star of Hades, and uttered
exiguous voices in the land beyond Cocytus.</p>
<p>There was something strangely exasperating, as well as
strangely wearying, in these uncommanded evolutions.&nbsp; It is
bitter to return to infancy, to be supported, and directed, and
perpetually set upon your feet, by the hand of some one
else.&nbsp; The air besides, as it is supplied to you by the busy
millers on the platform, closes the eustachian tubes and keeps
the neophyte perpetually swallowing, till his throat is grown so
dry that he can swallow no longer.&nbsp; And for all these
reasons-although I had a fine, dizzy, muddle-headed joy in my
surroundings, and longed, and tried, and always failed, to lay
hands on the fish that darted here and there about me, swift as
humming-birds&mdash;yet I fancy I was rather relieved than
otherwise when Bain brought me back to the ladder and signed to
me to mount.&nbsp; And there was one more experience before me
even then.&nbsp; Of a sudden, my ascending head passed into the
trough of a swell.&nbsp; Out of the green, I shot at once into a
glory of rosy, almost of sanguine light&mdash;the multitudinous
seas incarnadined, the heaven above a vault of crimson.&nbsp; And
then the glory faded into the hard, ugly daylight of a Caithness
autumn, with a low sky, a gray sea, and a whistling wind.</p>
<p>Bob Bain had five shillings for his trouble, and I had done
what I desired.&nbsp; It was one of the best things I got from my
education as an engineer: of which, however, as a way of life, I
wish to speak with sympathy.&nbsp; It takes a man into the open
air; it keeps him hanging about harbour-sides, which is the
richest form of idling; it carries him to wild islands; it gives
him a taste of the genial dangers of the sea; it supplies him
with dexterities to exercise; it makes demands upon his
ingenuity; it will go far to cure him of any taste (if ever he
had one) for the miserable life of cities.&nbsp; And when it has
done so, it carries him back and shuts him in an office!&nbsp;
From the roaring skerry and the wet thwart of the tossing boat,
he passes to the stool and desk; and with a memory full of ships,
and seas, and perilous headlands, and the shining pharos, he must
apply his long-sighted eyes to the petty niceties of drawing, or
measure his inaccurate mind with several pages of consecutive
figures.&nbsp; He is a wise youth, to be sure, who can balance
one part of genuine life against two parts of drudgery between
four walls, and for the sake of the one, manfully accept the
other.</p>
<p>Wick was scarce an eligible place of stay.&nbsp; But how much
better it was to hang in the cold wind upon the pier, to go down
with Bob Bain among the roots of the staging, to be all day in a
boat coiling a wet rope and shouting orders&mdash;not always very
wise&mdash;than to be warm and dry, and dull, and dead-alive, in
the most comfortable office.&nbsp; And Wick itself had in those
days a note of originality.&nbsp; It may have still, but I
misdoubt it much.&nbsp; The old minister of Keiss would not
preach, in these degenerate times, for an hour and a half upon
the clock.&nbsp; The gipsies must be gone from their cavern;
where you might see, from the mouth, the women tending their
fire, like Meg Merrilies, and the men sleeping off their coarse
potations; and where, in winter gales, the surf would beleaguer
them closely, bursting in their very door.&nbsp; A traveller
to-day upon the Thurso coach would scarce observe a little cloud
of smoke among the moorlands, and be told, quite openly, it
marked a private still.&nbsp; He would not indeed make that
journey, for there is now no Thurso coach.&nbsp; And even if he
could, one little thing that happened to me could never happen to
him, or not with the same trenchancy of contrast.</p>
<p>We had been upon the road all evening; the coach-top was
crowded with Lews fishers going home, scarce anything but Gaelic
had sounded in my ears; and our way had lain throughout over a
moorish country very northern to behold.&nbsp; Latish at night,
though it was still broad day in our subarctic latitude, we came
down upon the shores of the roaring Pentland Firth, that grave of
mariners; on one hand, the cliffs of Dunnet Head ran seaward; in
front was the little bare, white town of Castleton, its streets
full of blowing sand; nothing beyond, but the North Islands, the
great deep, and the perennial ice-fields of the Pole.&nbsp; And
here, in the last imaginable place, there sprang up young
outlandish voices and a chatter of some foreign speech; and I
saw, pursuing the coach with its load of Hebridean
fishers&mdash;as they had pursued <i>vetturini</i> up the passes
of the Apennines or perhaps along the grotto under Virgil&rsquo;s
tomb&mdash;two little dark-eyed, white-toothed Italian vagabonds,
of twelve to fourteen years of age, one with a hurdy-gurdy, the
other with a cage of white mice.&nbsp; The coach passed on, and
their small Italian chatter died in the distance; and I was left
to marvel how they had wandered into that country, and how they
fared in it, and what they thought of it, and when (if ever) they
should see again the silver wind-breaks run among the olives, and
the stone-pine stand guard upon Etruscan sepulchres.</p>
<p>Upon any American, the strangeness of this incident is
somewhat lost.&nbsp; For as far back as he goes in his own land,
he will find some alien camping there; the Cornish miner, the
French or Mexican half-blood, the negro in the South, these are
deep in the woods and far among the mountains.&nbsp; But in an
old, cold, and rugged country such as mine, the days of
immigration are long at an end; and away up there, which was at
that time far beyond the northernmost extreme of railways, hard
upon the shore of that ill-omened strait of whirlpools, in a land
of moors where no stranger came, unless it should be a sportsman
to shoot grouse or an antiquary to decipher runes, the presence
of these small pedestrians struck the mind as though a
bird-of-paradise had risen from the heather or an albatross come
fishing in the bay of Wick.&nbsp; They were as strange to their
surroundings as my lordly evangelist or the old Spanish grandee
on the Fair Isle.</p>

THE LANTERN-BEARERS</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> boys congregated every autumn
about a certain easterly fisher-village, where they tasted in a
high degree the glory of existence.&nbsp; The place was created
seemingly on purpose for the diversion of young gentlemen.&nbsp;
A street or two of houses, mostly red and many of, them tiled; a
number of fine trees clustered about the manse and the kirkyard,
and turning the chief street into a shady alley; many little
gardens more than usually bright with flowers; nets a-drying, and
fisher-wives scolding in the backward parts; a smell of fish, a
genial smell of seaweed; whiffs of blowing sand at the
street-corners; shops with golf-balls and bottled lollipops;
another shop with penny pickwicks (that remarkable cigar) and the
<i>London Journal</i>, dear to me for its startling pictures, and
a few novels, dear for their suggestive names: such, as well as
memory serves me, were the ingredients of the town.&nbsp; These,
you are to conceive posted on a spit between two sandy bays, and
sparsely flanked with villas enough for the boys to lodge in with
their subsidiary parents, not enough (not yet enough) to cocknify
the scene: a haven in the rocks in front: in front of that, a
file of gray islets: to the left, endless links and sand wreaths,
a wilderness of hiding-holes, alive with popping rabbits and
soaring gulls: to the right, a range of seaward crags, one rugged
brow beyond another; the ruins of a mighty and ancient fortress
on the brink of one; coves between&mdash;now charmed into
sunshine quiet, now whistling with wind and clamorous with
bursting surges; the dens and sheltered hollows redolent of thyme
and southernwood, the air at the cliff&rsquo;s edge brisk and
clean and pungent of the sea&mdash;in front of all, the Bass
Rock, tilted seaward like a doubtful bather, the surf ringing it
with white, the solan-geese hanging round its summit like a great
and glittering smoke.&nbsp; This choice piece of seaboard was
sacred, besides, to the wrecker; and the Bass, in the eye of
fancy, still flew the colours of King James; and in the ear of
fancy the arches of Tantallon still rang with horse-shoe iron,
and echoed to the commands of Bell-the-Cat.</p>
<p>There was nothing to mar your days, if you were a boy
summering in that part, but the embarrassment of pleasure.&nbsp;
You might golf if you wanted; but I seem to have been better
employed.&nbsp; You might secrete yourself in the Lady&rsquo;s
Walk, a certain sunless dingle of elders, all mossed over by the
damp as green as grass, and dotted here and there by the
stream-side with roofless walls, the cold homes of
anchorites.&nbsp; To fit themselves for life, and with a special
eye to acquire the art of smoking, it was even common for the
boys to harbour there; and you might have seen a single penny
pickwick, honestly shared in lengths with a blunt knife, bestrew
the glen with these apprentices.&nbsp; Again, you might join our
fishing parties, where we sat perched as thick as solan-geese, a
covey of little anglers, boy and girl, angling over each
other&rsquo;s heads, to the to the much entanglement of lines and
loss of podleys and consequent shrill recrimination&mdash;shrill
as the geese themselves.&nbsp; Indeed, had that been all, you
might have done this often; but though fishing be a fine pastime,
the podley is scarce to be regarded as a dainty for the table;
and it was a point of honour that a boy should eat all that he
had taken.&nbsp; Or again, you might climb the Law, where the
whale&rsquo;s jawbone stood landmark in the buzzing wind, and
behold the face of many counties, and the smoke and spires of
many towns, and the sails of distant ships.&nbsp; You might
bathe, now in the flaws of fine weather, that we pathetically
call our summer, now in a gale of wind, with the sand scourging
your bare hide, your clothes thrashing abroad from underneath
their guardian stone, the froth of the great breakers casting you
headlong ere it had drowned your knees.&nbsp; Or you might
explore the tidal rocks, above all in the ebb of springs, when
the very roots of the hills were for the nonce discovered;
following my leader from one group to another, groping in
slippery tangle for the wreck of ships, wading in pools after the
abominable creatures of the sea, and ever with an eye cast
backward on the march off the tide and the menaced line of your
retreat.&nbsp; And then you might go Crusoeing, a word that
covers all extempore eating in the open air: digging perhaps a
house under the margin of the links, kindling a fire of the
sea-ware, and cooking apples there&mdash;if they were truly
apples, for I sometimes suppose the merchant must have played us
off with some inferior and quite local fruit capable of
resolving, in the neighbourhood of fire, into mere sand and smoke
and iodine; or perhaps pushing to Tantallon, you might lunch on
sandwiches and visions in the grassy court, while the wind hummed
in the crumbling turrets; or clambering along the coast, eat
geans <a name="citation141"></a><a href="#footnote141"
class="citation">[141]</a> (the worst, I must suppose, in
Christendom) from an adventurous gean tree that had taken root
under a cliff, where it was shaken with an ague of east wind, and
silvered after gales with salt, and grew so foreign among its
bleak surroundings that to eat of its produce was an adventure in
itself.</p>
<p>There are mingled some dismal memories with so many that were
joyous.&nbsp; Of the fisher-wife, for instance, who had cut her
throat at Canty Bay; and of how I ran with the other children to
the top of the Quadrant, and beheld a posse of silent people
escorting a cart, and on the cart, bound in a chair, her throat
bandaged, and the bandage all bloody&mdash;horror!&mdash;the
fisher-wife herself, who continued thenceforth to hag-ride my
thoughts, and even to-day (as I recall the scene) darkens
daylight.&nbsp; She was lodged in the little old jail in the
chief street; but whether or no she died there, with a wise
terror of the worst, I never inquired.&nbsp; She had been
tippling; it was but a dingy tragedy; and it seems strange and
hard that, after all these years, the poor crazy sinner should be
still pilloried on her cart in the scrap-book of my memory.&nbsp;
Nor shall I readily forget a certain house in the Quadrant where
a visitor died, and a dark old woman continued to dwell alone
with the dead body; nor how this old woman conceived a hatred to
myself and one of my cousins, and in the dread hour of the dusk,
as we were clambering on the garden-walls, opened a window in
that house of mortality and cursed us in a shrill voice and with
a marrowy choice of language.&nbsp; It was a pair of very
colourless urchins that fled down the lane from this remarkable
experience!&nbsp; But I recall with a more doubtful sentiment,
compounded out of fear and exultation, the coil of equinoctial
tempests; trumpeting squalls, scouring flaws of rain; the boats
with their reefed lugsails scudding for the harbour mouth, where
danger lay, for it was hard to make when the wind had any east in
it; the wives clustered with blowing shawls at the pier-head,
where (if fate was against them) they might see boat and husband
and sons&mdash;their whole wealth and their whole
family&mdash;engulfed under their eyes; and (what I saw but once)
a troop of neighbours forcing such an unfortunate homeward, and
she squalling and battling in their midst, a figure scarcely
human, a tragic M&aelig;nad.</p>
<p>These are things that I recall with interest; but what my
memory dwells upon the most, I have been all this while
withholding.&nbsp; It was a sport peculiar to the place, and
indeed to a week or so of our two months&rsquo; holiday
there.&nbsp; Maybe it still flourishes in its native spot; for
boys and their pastimes are swayed by periodic forces inscrutable
to man; so that tops and marbles reappear in their due season,
regular like the sun and moon; and the harmless art of
knucklebones has seen the fall of the Roman empire and the rise
of the United States.&nbsp; It may still flourish in its native
spot, but nowhere else, I am persuaded; for I tried myself to
introduce it on Tweedside, and was defeated lamentably; its charm
being quite local, like a country wine that cannot be
exported.</p>
<p>The idle manner of it was this:&mdash;</p>
<p>Toward the end of September, when school-time was drawing near
and the nights were already black, we would begin to sally from
our-respective villas, each equipped with a tin bull&rsquo;s-eye
lantern.&nbsp; The thing was so well known that it had worn a rut
in the commerce of Great Britain; and the grocers, about the due
time, began to garnish their windows with our particular brand of
luminary.&nbsp; We wore them buckled to the waist upon a cricket
belt, and over them, such was the rigour of the game, a buttoned
top-coat.&nbsp; They smelled noisomely of blistered tin; they
never burned aright, though they would always burn our fingers;
their use was naught; the pleasure of them merely fanciful; and
yet a boy with a bull&rsquo;s-eye under his top-coat asked for
nothing more.&nbsp; The fishermen used lanterns about their
boats, and it was from them, I suppose, that we had got the hint;
but theirs were not bull&rsquo;s-eyes, nor did we ever play at
being fishermen.&nbsp; The police carried them at their belts,
and we had plainly copied them in that; yet we did not pretend to
be policemen.&nbsp; Burglars, indeed, we may have had some
haunting thoughts of; and we had certainly an eye to past ages
when lanterns were more common, and to certain story-books in
which we had found them to figure very largely.&nbsp; But take it
for all in all, the pleasure of the thing was substantive; and to
be a boy with a bull&rsquo;s-eye under his top-coat was good
enough for us.</p>
<p>When two of these asses met, there would be an anxious
&ldquo;Have you got your lantern?&rdquo; and a gratified
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; That was the shibboleth, and very needful too;
for, as it was the rule to keep our glory contained, none could
recognise a lantern-bearer, unless (like the polecat) by the
smell.&nbsp; Four or five would sometimes climb into the belly of
a ten-man lugger, with nothing but the thwarts above
them&mdash;for the cabin was usually locked, or choose out some
hollow of the links where the wind might whistle overhead.&nbsp;
There the coats would be unbuttoned and the bull&rsquo;s-eyes
discovered; and in the chequering glimmer, under the huge windy
hall of the night, and cheered by a rich steam of toasting
tinware, these fortunate young gentlemen would crouch together in
the cold sand of the links or on the scaly bilges of the
fishing-boat, and delight themselves with inappropriate
talk.&nbsp; Woe is me that I may not give some
specimens&mdash;some of their foresights of life, or deep
inquiries into the rudiments of man and nature, these were so
fiery and so innocent, they were so richly silly, so romantically
young.&nbsp; But the talk, at any rate, was but a condiment; and
these gatherings themselves only accidents in the career of the
lantern-bearer.&nbsp; The essence of this bliss was to walk by
yourself in the black night; the slide shut, the top-coat
buttoned; not a ray escaping, whether to conduct your footsteps
or to make your glory public: a mere pillar of darkness in the
dark; and all the while, deep down in the privacy of your
fool&rsquo;s heart, to know you had a bull&rsquo;s-eye at your
belt, and to exult and sing over the knowledge.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>It is said that a poet has died young in the breast of the
most stolid.&nbsp; It may be contended, rather, that this
(somewhat minor) bard in almost every case survives, and is the
spice of life to his possessor.&nbsp; Justice is not done to the
versatility and the unplumbed childishness of man&rsquo;s
imagination.&nbsp; His life from without may seem but a rude
mound of mud; there will be some golden chamber at the heart of
it, in which he dwells delighted; and for as dark as his pathway
seems to the observer, he will have some kind of a
bull&rsquo;s-eye at his belt.</p>
<p>It would be hard to pick out a career more cheerless than that
of Dancer, the miser, as he figures in the &ldquo;Old Bailey
Reports,&rdquo; a prey to the most sordid persecutions, the butt
of his neighbourhood, betrayed by his hired man, his house
beleaguered by the impish schoolboy, and he himself grinding and
fuming and impotently fleeing to the law against these
pin-pricks.&nbsp; You marvel at first that any one should
willingly prolong a life so destitute of charm and dignity; and
then you call to memory that had he chosen, had he ceased to be a
miser, he could have been freed at once from these trials, and
might have built himself a castle and gone escorted by a
squadron.&nbsp; For the love of more recondite joys, which we
cannot estimate, which, it may be, we should envy, the man had
willingly forgone both comfort and consideration.&nbsp;
&ldquo;His mind to him a kingdom was&rdquo;; and sure enough,
digging into that mind, which seems at first a dust-heap, we
unearth some priceless jewels.&nbsp; For Dancer must have had the
love of power and the disdain of using it, a noble character in
itself; disdain of many pleasures, a chief part of what is
commonly called wisdom; disdain of the inevitable end, that
finest trait of mankind; scorn of men&rsquo;s opinions, another
element of virtue; and at the back of all, a conscience just like
yours and mine, whining like a cur, swindling like a
thimble-rigger, but still pointing (there or there-about) to some
conventional standard.&nbsp; Here were a cabinet portrait to
which Hawthorne perhaps had done justice; and yet not Hawthorne
either, for he was mildly minded, and it lay not in him to create
for us that throb of the miser&rsquo;s pulse, his fretful energy
of gusto, his vast arms of ambition clutching in he knows not
what: insatiable, insane, a god with a muck-rake.&nbsp; Thus, at
least, looking in the bosom of the miser, consideration detects
the poet in the full tide of life, with more, indeed, of the
poetic fire than usually goes to epics; and tracing that mean man
about his cold hearth, and to and fro in his discomfortable
house, spies within him a blazing bonfire of delight.&nbsp; And
so with others, who do not live by bread alone, but by some
cherished and perhaps fantastic pleasure; who are meat salesmen
to the external eye, and possibly to themselves are Shakespeares,
Napoleons, or Beethovens; who have not one virtue to rub against
another in the field of active life, and yet perhaps, in the life
of contemplation, sit with the saints.&nbsp; We see them on the
street, and we can count their buttons; but heaven knows in what
they pride themselves! heaven knows where they have set their
treasure!</p>
<p>There is one fable that touches very near the quick of life:
the fable of the monk who passed into the woods, heard a bird
break into song, hearkened for a trill or two, and found himself
on his return a stranger at his convent gates; for he had been
absent fifty years, and of all his comrades there survived but
one to recognise him.&nbsp; It is not only in the woods that this
enchanter carols, though perhaps he is native there.&nbsp; He
sings in the most doleful places.&nbsp; The miser hears him and
chuckles, and the days are moments.&nbsp; With no more apparatus
than an ill-smelling lantern I have evoked him on the naked
links.&nbsp; All life that is not merely mechanical is spun out
of two strands: seeking for that bird and hearing him.&nbsp; And
it is just this that makes life so hard to value, and the delight
of each so incommunicable.&nbsp; And just a knowledge of this,
and a remembrance of those fortunate hours in which the bird has
sung to us, that fills us with such wonder when we turn the pages
of the realist.&nbsp; There, to be sure, we find a picture of
life in so far as it consists of mud and of old iron, cheap
desires and cheap fears, that which we are ashamed to remember
and that which we are careless whether we forget; but of the note
of that time-devouring nightingale we hear no news.</p>
<p>The case of these writers of romance is most obscure.&nbsp;
They have been boys and youths; they have lingered outside the
window of the beloved, who was then most probably writing to some
one else; they have sat before a sheet of paper, and felt
themselves mere continents of congested poetry, not one line of
which would flow; they have walked alone in the woods, they have
walked in cities under the countless lamps; they have been to
sea, they have hated, they have feared, they have longed to knife
a man, and maybe done it; the wild taste of life has stung their
palate.&nbsp; Or, if you deny them all the rest, one pleasure at
least they have tasted to the full&mdash;their books are there to
prove it&mdash;the keen pleasure of successful literary
composition.&nbsp; And yet they fill the globe with volumes,
whose cleverness inspires me with despairing admiration, and
whose consistent falsity to all I care to call existence, with
despairing wrath.&nbsp; If I had no better hope than to continue
to revolve among the dreary and petty businesses, and to be moved
by the paltry hopes and fears with which they surround and
animate their heroes, I declare I would die now.&nbsp; But there
has never an hour of mine gone quite so dully yet; if it were
spent waiting at a railway junction, I would have some scattering
thoughts, I could count some grains of memory, compared to which
the whole of one of these romances seems but dross.</p>
<p>These writers would retort (if I take them properly) that this
was very true; that it was the same with themselves and other
persons of (what they call) the artistic temperament; that in
this we were exceptional, and should apparently be ashamed of
ourselves; but that our works must deal exclusively with (what
they call) the average man, who was a prodigious dull fellow, and
quite dead to all but the paltriest considerations.&nbsp; I
accept the issue.&nbsp; We can only know others by
ourselves.&nbsp; The artistic temperament (a plague on the
expression!) does not make us different from our fellowmen, or it
would make us incapable of writing novels; and the average man (a
murrain on the word!) is just like you and me, or he would not be
average.&nbsp; It was Whitman who stamped a kind of Birmingham
sacredness upon the latter phrase; but Whitman knew very well,
and showed very nobly, that the average man was full of joys and
full of a poetry of his own.&nbsp; And this harping on
life&rsquo;s dulness and man&rsquo;s meanness is a loud
profession of incompetence; it is one of two things: the cry of
the blind eye, <i>I cannot see</i>, or the complaint of the dumb
tongue, <i>I cannot utter</i>.&nbsp; To draw a life without
delights is to prove I have not realised it.&nbsp; To picture a
man without some sort of poetry&mdash;well, it goes near to prove
my case, for it shows an author may have little enough.&nbsp; To
see Dancer only as a dirty, old, small-minded, impotently fuming
man, in a dirty house, besieged by Harrow boys, and probably
beset by small attorneys, is to show myself as keen an observer
as . . . the Harrow boys.&nbsp; But these young gentlemen (with a
more becoming modesty) were content to pluck Dancer by the
coat-tails; they did not suppose they had surprised his secret or
could put him living in a book: and it is there my error would
have lain.&nbsp; Or say that in the same romance&mdash;I continue
to call these books romances, in the hope of giving
pain&mdash;say that in the same romance, which now begins really
to take shape, I should leave to speak of Dancer, and follow
instead the Harrow boys; and say that I came on some such
business as that of my lantern-bearers on the links; and
described the boys as very cold, spat upon by flurries of rain,
and drearily surrounded, all of which they were; and their talk
as silly and indecent, which it certainly was.&nbsp; I might upon
these lines, and had I Zola&rsquo;s genius, turn out, in a page
or so, a gem of literary art, render the lantern-light with the
touches of a master, and lay on the indecency with the ungrudging
hand of love; and when all was done, what a triumph would my
picture be of shallowness and dulness! how it would have missed
the point! how it would have belied the boys!&nbsp; To the ear of
the stenographer, the talk is merely silly and indecent; but ask
the boys themselves, and they are discussing (as it is highly
proper they should) the possibilities of existence.&nbsp; To the
eye of the observer they are wet and cold and drearily
surrounded; but ask themselves, and they are in the heaven of a
recondite pleasure, the ground of which is an ill-smelling
lantern.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>For, to repeat, the ground of a man&rsquo;s joy is often hard
to hit.&nbsp; It may hinge at times upon a mere accessory, like
the lantern; it may reside, like Dancer&rsquo;s, in the
mysterious inwards of psychology.&nbsp; It may consist with
perpetual failure, and find exercise in the continued
chase.&nbsp; It has so little bond with externals (such as the
observer scribbles in his note-book) that it may even touch them
not; and the man&rsquo;s true life, for which he consents to
live, lie altogether in the field of fancy.&nbsp; The clergyman,
in his spare hours, may be winning battles, the farmer sailing
ships, the banker reaping triumph in the arts: all leading
another life, plying another trade from that they chose; like the
poet&rsquo;s housebuilder, who, after all, is cased in stone,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By his fireside, as impotent fancy
prompts.<br />
Rebuilds it to his liking.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In such a case the poetry runs underground.&nbsp; The observer
(poor soul, with his documents!) is all abroad.&nbsp; For to look
at the man is but to court deception.&nbsp; We shall see the
trunk from which he draws his nourishment; but he himself is
above and abroad in the green dome of foliage, hummed through by
winds and nested in by nightingales.&nbsp; And the true realism
were that of the poets, to climb up after him like a squirrel,
and catch some glimpse of the heaven for which he lives.</p>
<p>And, the true realism, always and everywhere, is that of the
poets: to find out where joy resides, and give it a voice far
beyond singing.</p>
<p>For to miss the joy is to miss all.&nbsp; In the joy of the
actors lies the sense of any action.&nbsp; That is the
explanation, that the excuse.&nbsp; To one who has not the secret
of the lanterns, the scene upon the links is meaningless.&nbsp;
And hence the haunting and truly spectral unreality of realistic
books.&nbsp; Hence, when we read the English realists, the
incredulous wonder with which we observe the hero&rsquo;s
constancy under the submerging tide of dulness, and how he bears
up with his jibbing sweetheart, and endures the chatter of idiot
girls, and stands by his whole unfeatured wilderness of an
existence, instead of seeking relief in drink or foreign
travel.&nbsp; Hence in the French, in that meat-market of
middle-aged sensuality, the disgusted surprise with which we see
the hero drift sidelong, and practically quite untempted, into
every description of misconduct and dishonour.&nbsp; In each, we
miss the personal poetry, the enchanted atmosphere, that rainbow
work of fancy that clothes what is naked and seems to ennoble
what is base; in each, life falls dead like dough, instead of
soaring away like a balloon into the colours of the sunset; each
is true, each inconceivable; for no man lives in the external
truth, among salts and acids, but in the warm, phantasmagoric
chamber of his brain, with the painted windows and the storied
walls.</p>
<p>Of this falsity we have had a recent example from a man who
knows far better&mdash;Tolstoi&rsquo;s <i>Powers of
Darkness</i>.&nbsp; Here is a piece full of force and truth, yet
quite untrue.&nbsp; For before Mikita was led into so dire a
situation he was tempted, and temptations are beautiful at least
in part; and a work which dwells on the ugliness of crime and
gives no hint of any loveliness in the temptation, sins against
the modesty of life, and even when a Tolstoi writes it, sinks to
melodrama.&nbsp; The peasants are not understood; they saw their
life in fairer colours; even the deaf girl was clothed in poetry
for Mikita, or he had never fallen.&nbsp; And so, once again,
even an Old Bailey melodrama, without some brightness of poetry
and lustre of existence, falls into the inconceivable and ranks
with fairy tales.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>In nobler books we are moved with something like the emotions
of life; and this emotion is very variously provoked.&nbsp; We
are so moved when Levine labours in the field, when Andr&eacute;
sinks beyond emotion, when Richard Feverel and Lucy Desborough
meet beside the river, when Antony, &ldquo;not cowardly, puts off
his helmet,&rdquo; when Kent has infinite pity on the dying Lear,
when, in Dostoieffky&rsquo;s <i>Despised and Rejected</i>, the
uncomplaining hero drains his cup of suffering and virtue.&nbsp;
These are notes that please the great heart of man.&nbsp; Not
only love, and the fields, and the bright face of danger, but
sacrifice and death and unmerited suffering humbly supported,
touch in us the vein of the poetic.&nbsp; We love to think of
them, we long to try them, we are humbly hopeful that we may
prove heroes also.</p>
<p>We have heard, perhaps, too much of lesser matters.&nbsp; Here
is the door, here is the open air.&nbsp; <i>Itur in antiquam
silvam</i>.</p>

153</span>VIII<br />
A CHAPTER ON DREAMS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> past is all of one
texture&mdash;whether feigned or suffered&mdash;whether acted out
in three dimensions, or only witnessed in that small theatre of
the brain which we keep brightly lighted all night long, after
the jets are down, and darkness and sleep reign undisturbed in
the remainder of the body.&nbsp; There is no distinction on the
face of our experiences; one is vivid indeed, and one dull, and
one pleasant, and another agonising to remember; but which of
them is what we call true, and which a dream, there is not one
hair to prove.&nbsp; The past stands on a precarious footing;
another straw split in the field of metaphysic, and behold us
robbed of it.&nbsp; There is scarce a family that can count four
generations but lays a claim to some dormant title or some castle
and estate: a claim not prosecutable in any court of law, but
flattering to the fancy and a great alleviation of idle
hours.&nbsp; A man&rsquo;s claim to his own past is yet less
valid.&nbsp; A paper might turn up (in proper story-book fashion)
in the secret drawer of an old ebony secretary, and restore your
family to its ancient honours, and reinstate mine in a certain
West Indian islet (not far from St. Kitt&rsquo;s, as beloved
tradition hummed in my young ears) which was once ours, and is
now unjustly some one else&rsquo;s, and for that matter (in the
state of the sugar trade) is not worth anything to anybody.&nbsp;
I do not say that these revolutions are likely; only no man can
deny that they are possible; and the past, on the other baud, is,
lost for ever: our old days and deeds, our old selves, too, and
the very world in which these scenes were acted, all brought down
to the same faint residuum as a last night&rsquo;s dream, to some
incontinuous images, and an echo in the chambers of the
brain.&nbsp; Not an hour, not a mood, not a glance of the eye,
can we revoke; it is all gone, past conjuring.&nbsp; And yet
conceive us robbed of it, conceive that little thread of memory
that we trail behind us broken at the pocket&rsquo;s edge; and in
what naked nullity should we be left! for we only guide
ourselves, and only know ourselves, by these air-painted pictures
of the past.</p>
<p>Upon these grounds, there are some among us who claim to have
lived longer and more richly than their neighbours; when they lay
asleep they claim they were still active; and among the treasures
of memory that all men review for their amusement, these count in
no second place the harvests of their dreams.&nbsp; There is one
of this kind whom I have in my eye, and whose case is perhaps
unusual enough to be described.&nbsp; He was from a child an
ardent and uncomfortable dreamer.&nbsp; When he had a touch of
fever at night, and the room swelled and shrank, and his clothes,
hanging on a nail, now loomed up instant to the bigness of a
church, and now drew away into a horror of infinite distance and
infinite littleness, the poor soul was very well aware of what
must follow, and struggled hard against the approaches of that
slumber which was the beginning of sorrows.</p>
<p>But his struggles were in vain; sooner or later the night-hag
would have him by the throat, and pluck him strangling and
screaming, from his sleep.&nbsp; His dreams were at times
commonplace enough, at times very strange, at times they were
almost formless: he would be haunted, for instance, by nothing
more definite than a certain hue of brown, which he did not mind
in the least while he was awake, but feared and loathed while he
was dreaming; at times, again, they took on every detail of
circumstance, as when once he supposed he must swallow the
populous world, and awoke screaming with the horror of the
thought.&nbsp; The two chief troubles of his very narrow
existence&mdash;the practical and everyday trouble of school
tasks and the ultimate and airy one of hell and
judgment&mdash;were often confounded together into one appalling
nightmare.&nbsp; He seemed to himself to stand before the Great
White Throne; he was called on, poor little devil, to recite some
form of words, on which his destiny depended; his tongue stuck,
his memory was blank, hell gaped for him; and he would awake,
clinging to the curtain-rod with his knees to his chin.</p>
<p>These were extremely poor experiences, on the whole; and at
that time of life my dreamer would have very willingly parted
with his power of dreams.&nbsp; But presently, in the course of
his growth, the cries and physical contortions passed away,
seemingly for ever; his visions were still for the most part
miserable, but they were more constantly supported; and he would
awake with no more extreme symptom than a flying heart, a
freezing scalp, cold sweats, and the speechless midnight
fear.&nbsp; His dreams, too, as befitted a mind better stocked
with particulars, became more circumstantial, and had more the
air and continuity of life.&nbsp; The look of the world beginning
to take hold on his attention, scenery came to play a part in his
sleeping as well as in his waking thoughts, so that he would take
long, uneventful journeys and see strange towns and beautiful
places as he lay in bed.&nbsp; And, what is more significant, an
odd taste that he had for the Georgian costume and for stories
laid in that period of English history, began to rule the
features of his dreams; so that he masqueraded there in a
three-cornered hat and was much engaged with Jacobite conspiracy
between the hour for bed and that for breakfast.&nbsp; About the
same time, he began to read in his dreams&mdash;tales, for the
most part, and for the most part after the manner of G. P. R.
James, but so incredibly more vivid and moving than any printed
book, that he has ever since been malcontent with literature.</p>
<p>And then, while he was yet a student, there came to him a
dream-adventure which he has no anxiety to repeat; he began, that
is to say, to dream in sequence and thus to lead a double
life&mdash;one of the day, one of the night&mdash;one that he had
every reason to believe was the true one, another that he had no
means of proving to be false.&nbsp; I should have said he
studied, or was by way of studying, at Edinburgh College, which
(it may be supposed) was how I came to know him.&nbsp; Well, in
his dream-life, he passed a long day in the surgical theatre, his
heart in his mouth, his teeth on edge, seeing monstrous
malformations and the abhorred dexterity of surgeons.&nbsp; In a
heavy, rainy, foggy evening he came forth into the South Bridge,
turned up the High Street, and entered the door of a tall
<i>land</i>, at the top of which he supposed himself to
lodge.&nbsp; All night long, in his wet clothes, he climbed the
stairs, stair after stair in endless series, and at every second
flight a flaring lamp with a reflector.&nbsp; All night long, he
brushed by single persons passing downward&mdash;beggarly women
of the street, great, weary, muddy labourers, poor scarecrows of
men, pale parodies of women&mdash;but all drowsy and weary like
himself, and all single, and all brushing against him as they
passed.&nbsp; In the end, out of a northern window, he would see
day beginning to whiten over the Firth, give up the ascent, turn
to descend, and in a breath be back again upon the streets, in
his wet clothes, in the wet, haggard dawn, trudging to another
day of monstrosities and operations.&nbsp; Time went quicker in
the life of dreams, some seven hours (as near as he can guess) to
one; and it went, besides, more intensely, so that the gloom of
these fancied experiences clouded the day, and he had not shaken
off their shadow ere it was time to lie down and to renew
them.&nbsp; I cannot tell how long it was that he endured this
discipline; but it was long enough to leave a great black blot
upon his memory, long enough to send him, trembling for his
reason, to the doors of a certain doctor; whereupon with a simple
draught he was restored to the common lot of man.</p>
<p>The poor gentleman has since been troubled by nothing of the
sort; indeed, his nights were for some while like other
men&rsquo;s, now blank, now chequered with dreams, and these
sometimes charming, sometimes appalling, but except for an
occasional vividness, of no extraordinary kind.&nbsp; I will just
note one of these occasions, ere I pass on to what makes my
dreamer truly interesting.&nbsp; It seemed to him that he was in
the first floor of a rough hill-farm.&nbsp; The room showed some
poor efforts at gentility, a carpet on the floor, a piano, I
think, against the wall; but, for all these refinements, there
was no mistaking he was in a moorland place, among hillside
people, and set in miles of heather.&nbsp; He looked down from
the window upon a bare farmyard, that seemed to have been long
disused.&nbsp; A great, uneasy stillness lay upon the
world.&nbsp; There was no sign of the farm-folk or of any live
stock, save for an old, brown, curly dog of the retriever breed,
who sat close in against the wall of the house and seemed to be
dozing.&nbsp; Something about this dog disquieted the dreamer; it
was quite a nameless feeling, for the beast looked right
enough&mdash;indeed, he was so old and dull and dusty and
broken-down, that he should rather have awakened pity; and yet
the conviction came and grew upon the dreamer that this was no
proper dog at all, but something hellish.&nbsp; A great many
dozing summer flies hummed about the yard; and presently the dog
thrust forth his paw, caught a fly in his open palm, carried it
to his mouth like an ape, and looking suddenly up at the dreamer
in the window, winked to him with one eye.&nbsp; The dream went
on, it matters not how it went; it was a good dream as dreams go;
but there was nothing in the sequel worthy of that devilish brown
dog.&nbsp; And the point of interest for me lies partly in that
very fact: that having found so singular an incident, my
imperfect dreamer should prove unable to carry the tale to a fit
end and fall back on indescribable noises and indiscriminate
horrors.&nbsp; It would be different now; he knows his business
better!</p>
<p>For, to approach at last the point: This honest fellow had
long been in the custom of setting himself to sleep with tales,
and so had his father before him; but these were irresponsible
inventions, told for the teller&rsquo;s pleasure, with no eye to
the crass public or the thwart reviewer: tales where a thread
might be dropped, or one adventure quitted for another, on
fancy&rsquo;s least suggestion.&nbsp; So that the little people
who manage man&rsquo;s internal theatre had not as yet received a
very rigorous training; and played upon their stage like children
who should have slipped into the house and found it empty, rather
than like drilled actors performing a set piece to a huge hall of
faces.&nbsp; But presently my dreamer began to turn his former
amusement of story-telling to (what is called) account; by which
I mean that he began to write and sell his tales.&nbsp; Here was
he, and here were the little people who did that part of his
business, in quite new conditions.&nbsp; The stories must now be
trimmed and pared and set upon all fours, they must run from a
beginning to an end and fit (after a manner) with the laws of
life; the pleasure, in one word, had become a business; and that
not only for the dreamer, but for the little people of his
theatre.&nbsp; These understood the change as well as he.&nbsp;
When he lay down to prepare himself for sleep, he no longer
sought amusement, but printable and profitable tales; and after
he had dozed off in his box-seat, his little people continued
their evolutions with the same mercantile designs.&nbsp; All
other forms of dream deserted him but two: he still occasionally
reads the most delightful books, he still visits at times the
most delightful places; and it is perhaps worthy of note that to
these same places, and to one in particular, he returns at
intervals of months and years, finding new field-paths, visiting
new neighbours, beholding that happy valley under new effects of
noon and dawn and sunset.&nbsp; But all the rest of the family of
visions is quite lost to him: the common, mangled version of
yesterday&rsquo;s affairs, the raw-head-and-bloody-bones
nightmare, rumoured to be the child of toasted cheese&mdash;these
and their like are gone; and, for the most part, whether awake or
asleep, he is simply occupied&mdash;he or his little
people&mdash;in consciously making stories for the market.&nbsp;
This dreamer (like many other persons) has encountered some
trifling vicissitudes of fortune.&nbsp; When the bank begins to
send letters and the butcher to linger at the back gate, he sets
to belabouring his brains after a story, for that is his readiest
money-winner; and, behold! at once the little people begin to
bestir themselves in the same quest, and labour all night long,
and all night long set before him truncheons of tales upon their
lighted theatre.&nbsp; No fear of his being frightened now; the
flying heart and the frozen scalp are things by-gone; applause,
growing applause, growing interest, growing exultation in his own
cleverness (for he takes all the credit), and at last a jubilant
leap to wakefulness, with the cry, &ldquo;I have it,
that&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; upon his lips: with such and similar
emotions he sits at these nocturnal dramas, with such outbreaks,
like Claudius in the play, he scatters the performance in the
midst.&nbsp; Often enough the waking is a disappointment: he has
been too deep asleep, as I explain the thing; drowsiness has
gained his little people, they have gone stumbling and maundering
through their parts; and the play, to the awakened mind, is seen
to be a tissue of absurdities.&nbsp; And yet how often have these
sleepless Brownies done him honest service, and given him, as he
sat idly taking his pleasure in the boxes, better tales than he
could fashion for himself.</p>
<p>Here is one, exactly as it came to him.&nbsp; It seemed he was
the son of a very rich and wicked man, the owner of broad acres
and a most damnable temper.&nbsp; The dreamer (and that was the
son) had lived much abroad, on purpose to avoid his parent; and
when at length he returned to England, it was to find him married
again to a young wife, who was supposed to suffer cruelly and to
loathe her yoke.&nbsp; Because of this marriage (as the dreamer
indistinctly understood) it was desirable for father and son to
have a meeting; and yet both being proud and both angry, neither
would condescend upon a visit.&nbsp; Meet they did accordingly,
in a desolate, sandy country by the sea; and there they
quarrelled, and the son, stung by some intolerable insult, struck
down the father dead.&nbsp; No suspicion was aroused; the dead
man was found and buried, and the dreamer succeeded to the broad
estates, and found himself installed under the same roof with his
father&rsquo;s widow, for whom no provision had been made.&nbsp;
These two lived very much alone, as people may after a
bereavement, sat down to table together, shared the long
evenings, and grew daily better friends; until it seemed to him
of a sudden that she was prying about dangerous matters, that she
had conceived a notion of his guilt, that she watched him and
tried him with questions.&nbsp; He drew back from her company as
men draw back from a precipice suddenly discovered; and yet so
strong was the attraction that he would drift again and again
into the old intimacy, and again and again be startled back by
some suggestive question or some inexplicable meaning in her
eye.&nbsp; So they lived at cross purposes, a life full of broken
dialogue, challenging glances, and suppressed passion; until, one
day, he saw the woman slipping from the house in a veil, followed
her to the station, followed her in the train to the seaside
country, and out over the sandhills to the very place where the
murder was done.&nbsp; There she began to grope among the bents,
he watching her, flat upon his face; and presently she had
something in her hand&mdash;I cannot remember what it was, but it
was deadly evidence against the dreamer&mdash;and as she held it
up to look at it, perhaps from the shock of the discovery, her
foot slipped, and she hung at some peril on the brink of the tall
sand-wreaths.&nbsp; He had no thought but to spring up and rescue
her; and there they stood face to face, she with that deadly
matter openly in her hand&mdash;his very presence on the spot
another link of proof.&nbsp; It was plain she was about to speak,
but this was more than he could bear&mdash;he could bear to be
lost, but not to talk of it with his destroyer; and he cut her
short with trivial conversation.&nbsp; Arm in arm, they returned
together to the train, talking he knew not what, made the journey
back in the same carriage, sat down to dinner, and passed the
evening in the drawing-room as in the past.&nbsp; But suspense
and fear drummed in the dreamer&rsquo;s bosom.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
has not denounced me yet&rdquo;&mdash;so his thoughts
ran&mdash;&ldquo;when will she denounce me?&nbsp; Will it be
to-morrow?&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was not to-morrow, nor the next
day, nor the next; and their life settled back on the old terms,
only that she seemed kinder than before, and that, as for him,
the burthen of his suspense and wonder grew daily more
unbearable, so that he wasted away like a man with a
disease.&nbsp; Once, indeed, he broke all bounds of decency,
seized an occasion when she was abroad, ransacked her room, and
at last, hidden away among her jewels, found the damning
evidence.&nbsp; There he stood, holding this thing, which was his
life, in the hollow of his hand, and marvelling at her
inconsequent behaviour, that she should seek, and keep, and yet
not use it; and then the door opened, and behold herself.&nbsp;
So, once more, they stood, eye to eye, with the evidence between
them; and once more she raised to him a face brimming with some
communication; and once more he shied away from speech and cut
her off.&nbsp; But before he left the room, which he had turned
upside down, he laid back his death-warrant where he had found
it; and at that, her face lighted up.&nbsp; The next thing he
heard, she was explaining to her maid, with some ingenious
falsehood, the disorder of her things.&nbsp; Flesh and blood
could bear the strain no longer; and I think it was the next
morning (though chronology is always hazy in the theatre of the
mind) that he burst from his reserve.&nbsp; They had been
breakfasting together in one corner of a great, parqueted,
sparely-furnished room of many windows; all the time of the meal
she had tortured him with sly allusions; and no sooner were the
servants gone, and these two protagonists alone together, than he
leaped to his feet.&nbsp; She too sprang up, with a pale face;
with a pale face, she heard him as he raved out his complaint:
Why did she torture him so? she knew all, she knew he was no
enemy to her; why did she not denounce him at once? what
signified her whole behaviour? why did she torture him? and yet
again, why did she torture him?&nbsp; And when he had done, she
fell upon her knees, and with outstretched hands:&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you not understand?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I love
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hereupon, with a pang of wonder and mercantile delight, the
dreamer awoke.&nbsp; His mercantile delight was not of long
endurance; for it soon became plain that in this spirited tale
there were unmarketable elements; which is just the reason why
you have it here so briefly told.&nbsp; But his wonder has still
kept growing; and I think the reader&rsquo;s will also, if he
consider it ripely.&nbsp; For now he sees why I speak of the
little people as of substantive inventors and performers.&nbsp;
To the end they had kept their secret.&nbsp; I will go bail for
the dreamer (having excellent grounds for valuing his candour)
that he had no guess whatever at the motive of the
woman&mdash;the hinge of the whole well-invented plot&mdash;until
the instant of that highly dramatic declaration.&nbsp; It was not
his tale; it was the little people&rsquo;s!&nbsp; And observe:
not only was the secret kept, the story was told with really
guileful craftsmanship.&nbsp; The conduct of both actors is (in
the cant phrase) psychologically correct, and the emotion aptly
graduated up to the surprising climax.&nbsp; I am awake now, and
I know this trade; and yet I cannot better it.&nbsp; I am awake,
and I live by this business; and yet I could not
outdo&mdash;could not perhaps equal&mdash;that crafty artifice
(as of some old, experienced carpenter of plays, some Dennery or
Sardou) by which the same situation is twice presented and the
two actors twice brought face to face over the evidence, only
once it is in her hand, once in his&mdash;and these in their due
order, the least dramatic first.&nbsp; The more I think of it,
the more I am moved to press upon the world my question: Who are
the Little People?&nbsp; They are near connections of the
dreamer&rsquo;s, beyond doubt; they share in his financial
worries and have an eye to the bank-book; they share plainly in
his training; they have plainly learned like him to build the
scheme of a considerate story and to arrange emotion in
progressive order; only I think they have more talent; and one
thing is beyond doubt, they can tell him a story piece by piece,
like a serial, and keep him all the while in ignorance of where
they aim.&nbsp; Who are they, then? and who is the dreamer?</p>
<p>Well, as regards the dreamer, I can answer that, for he is no
less a person than myself;&mdash;as I might have told you from
the beginning, only that the critics murmur over my consistent
egotism;&mdash;and as I am positively forced to tell you now, or
I could advance but little farther with my story.&nbsp; And for
the Little People, what shall I say they are but just my
Brownies, God bless them! who do one-half my work for me while I
am fast asleep, and in all human likelihood, do the rest for me
as well, when I am wide awake and fondly suppose I do it for
myself.&nbsp; That part which is done while I am sleeping is the
Brownies&rsquo; part beyond contention; but that which is done
when I am up and about is by no means necessarily mine, since all
goes to show the Brownies have a hand in it even then.&nbsp; Here
is a doubt that much concerns my conscience.&nbsp; For
myself&mdash;what I call I, my conscious ego, the denizen of the
pineal gland unless he has changed his residence since Descartes,
the man with the conscience and the variable bank-account, the
man with the hat and the boots, and the privilege of voting and
not carrying his candidate at the general elections&mdash;I am
sometimes tempted to suppose he is no story-teller at all, but a
creature as matter of fact as any cheesemonger or any cheese, and
a realist bemired up to the ears in actuality; so that, by that
account, the whole of my published fiction should be the
single-handed product of some Brownie, some Familiar, some unseen
collaborator, whom I keep locked in a back garret, while I get
all the praise and he but a share (which I cannot prevent him
getting) of the pudding.&nbsp; I am an excellent adviser,
something like Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s servant; I pull back and I
cut down; and I dress the whole in the best words and sentences
that I can find and make; I hold the pen, too; and I do the
sitting at the table, which is about the worst of it; and when
all is done, I make up the manuscript and pay for the
registration; so that, on the whole, I have some claim to share,
though not so largely as I do, in the profits of our common
enterprise.</p>
<p>I can but give an instance or so of what part is done sleeping
and what part awake, and leave the reader to share what laurels
there are, at his own nod, between myself and my collaborators;
and to do this I will first take a book that a number of persons
have been polite enough to read, the <i>Strange Case of Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i>.&nbsp; I had long been trying to write a
story on this subject, to find a body, a vehicle, for that strong
sense of man&rsquo;s double being which must at times come in
upon and overwhelm the mind of every thinking creature.&nbsp; I
had even written one, <i>The Travelling Companion</i>, which was
returned by an editor on the plea that it was a work of genius
and indecent, and which I burned the other day on the ground that
it was not a work of genius, and that <i>Jekyll</i> had
supplanted it.&nbsp; Then came one of those financial
fluctuations to which (with an elegant modesty) I have hitherto
referred in the third person.&nbsp; For two days I went about
racking my brains for a plot of any sort; and on the second night
I dreamed the scene at the window, and a scene afterward split in
two, in which Hyde, pursued for some crime, took the powder and
underwent the change in the presence of his pursuers.&nbsp; All
the rest was made awake, and consciously, although I think I can
trace in much of it the manner of my Brownies.&nbsp; The meaning
of the tale is therefore mine, and had long pre-existed in my
garden of Adonis, and tried one body after another in vain;
indeed, I do most of the morality, worse luck! and my Brownies
have not a rudiment of what we call a conscience.&nbsp; Mine,
too, is the setting, mine the characters.&nbsp; All that was
given me was the matter of three scenes, and the central idea of
a voluntary change becoming involuntary.&nbsp; Will it be thought
ungenerous, after I have been so liberally ladling out praise to
my unseen collaborators, if I here toss them over, bound hand and
foot, into the arena of the critics?&nbsp; For the business of
the powders, which so many have censured, is, I am relieved to
say, not mine at all but the Brownies&rsquo;.&nbsp; Of another
tale, in case the reader should have glanced at it, I may say a
word: the not very defensible story of <i>Olalla</i>.&nbsp; Here
the court, the mother, the mother&rsquo;s niche, Olalla,
Olalla&rsquo;s chamber, the meetings on the stair, the broken
window, the ugly scene of the bite, were all given me in bulk and
detail as I have tried to write them; to this I added only the
external scenery (for in my dream I never was beyond the court),
the portrait, the characters of Felipe and the priest, the moral,
such as it is, and the last pages, such as, alas! they are.&nbsp;
And I may even say that in this case the moral itself was given
me; for it arose immediately on a comparison of the mother and
the daughter, and from the hideous trick of atavism in the
first.&nbsp; Sometimes a parabolic sense is still more undeniably
present in a dream; sometimes I cannot but suppose my Brownies
have been aping Bunyan, and yet in no case with what would
possibly be called a moral in a tract; never with the ethical
narrowness; conveying hints instead of life&rsquo;s larger
limitations and that sort of sense which we seem to perceive in
the arabesque of time and space.</p>
<p>For the most part, it will be seen, my Brownies are somewhat
fantastic, like their stories hot and hot, full of passion and
the picturesque, alive with animating incident; and they have no
prejudice against the supernatural.&nbsp; But the other day they
gave me a surprise, entertaining me with a love-story, a little
April comedy, which I ought certainly to hand over to the author
of <i>A Chance Acquaintance</i>, for he could write it as it
should be written, and I am sure (although I mean to try) that I
cannot.&mdash;But who would have supposed that a Brownie of mine
should invent a tale for Mr. Howells?</p>

BEGGARS</h2>
<p>I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a pleasant, airy, up-hill
country, it was my fortune when I was young to make the
acquaintance of a certain beggar.&nbsp; I call him beggar, though
he usually allowed his coat and his shoes (which were
open-mouthed, indeed) to beg for him.&nbsp; He was the wreck of
an athletic man, tall, gaunt, and bronzed; far gone in
consumption, with that disquieting smile of the mortally stricken
on his face; but still active afoot, still with the brisk
military carriage, the ready military salute.&nbsp; Three ways
led through this piece of country; and as I was inconstant in my
choice, I believe he must often have awaited me in vain.&nbsp;
But often enough, he caught me; often enough, from some place of
ambush by the roadside, he would spring suddenly forth in the
regulation attitude, and launching at once into his
inconsequential talk, fall into step with me upon my farther
course.&nbsp; &ldquo;A fine morning, sir, though perhaps a trifle
inclining to rain.&nbsp; I hope I see you well, sir.&nbsp; Why,
no, sir, I don&rsquo;t feel as hearty myself as I could wish, but
I am keeping about my ordinary.&nbsp; I am pleased to meet you on
the road, sir.&nbsp; I assure you I quite look forward to one of
our little conversations.&rdquo;&nbsp; He loved the sound of his
own voice inordinately, and though (with something too off-hand
to call servility) he would always hasten to agree with anything
you said, yet he could never suffer you to say it to an
end.&nbsp; By what transition he slid to his favourite subject I
have no memory; but we had never been long together on the way
before he was dealing, in a very military manner, with the
English poets.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shelley was a fine poet, sir, though
a trifle atheistical in his opinions.&nbsp; His Queen Mab, sir,
is quite an atheistical work.&nbsp; Scott, sir, is not so
poetical a writer.&nbsp; With the works of Shakespeare I am not
so well acquainted, but he was a fine poet.&nbsp;
Keats&mdash;John Keats, sir&mdash;he was a very fine
poet.&rdquo;&nbsp; With such references, such trivial criticism,
such loving parade of his own knowledge, he would beguile the
road, striding forward uphill, his staff now clapped to the ribs
of his deep, resonant chest, now swinging in the air with the
remembered jauntiness of the private soldier; and all the while
his toes looking out of his boots, and his shirt looking out of
his elbows, and death looking out of his smile, and his big,
crazy frame shaken by accesses of cough.</p>
<p>He would often go the whole way home with me: often to borrow
a book, and that book always a poet.&nbsp; Off he would march, to
continue his mendicant rounds, with the volume slipped into the
pocket of his ragged coat; and although he would sometimes keep
it quite a while, yet it came always back again at last, not much
the worse for its travels into beggardom.&nbsp; And in this way,
doubtless, his knowledge grew and his glib, random criticism took
a wider range.&nbsp; But my library was not the first he had
drawn upon: at our first encounter, he was already brimful of
Shelley and the atheistical Queen Mab, and
&ldquo;Keats&mdash;John Keats, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I have often
wondered how he came by these acquirements; just as I often
wondered how he fell to be a beggar.&nbsp; He had served through
the Mutiny&mdash;of which (like so many people) he could tell
practically nothing beyond the names of places, and that it was
&ldquo;difficult work, sir,&rdquo; and very hot, or that
so-and-so was &ldquo;a very fine commander, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was far too smart a man to have remained a private; in the nature
of things, he must have won his stripes.&nbsp; And yet here he
was without a pension.&nbsp; When I touched on this problem, he
would content himself with diffidently offering me advice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A man should be very careful when he is young, sir.&nbsp;
If you&rsquo;ll excuse me saying so, a spirited young gentleman
like yourself, sir, should be very careful.&nbsp; I was perhaps a
trifle inclined to atheistical opinions myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; For
(perhaps with a deeper wisdom than we are inclined in these days
to admit) he plainly bracketed agnosticism with beer and
skittles.</p>
<p>Keats&mdash;John Keats, sir&mdash;and Shelley were his
favourite bards.&nbsp; I cannot remember if I tried him with
Rossetti; but I know his taste to a hair, and if ever I did, he
must have doted on that author.&nbsp; What took him was a
richness in the speech; he loved the exotic, the unexpected word;
the moving cadence of a phrase; a vague sense of emotion (about
nothing) in the very letters of the alphabet: the romance of
language.&nbsp; His honest head was very nearly empty, his
intellect like a child&rsquo;s; and when he read his favourite
authors, he can almost never have understood what he was
reading.&nbsp; Yet the taste was not only genuine, it was
exclusive; I tried in vain to offer him novels; he would none of
them, he cared for nothing but romantic language that he could
not understand.&nbsp; The case may be commoner than we
suppose.&nbsp; I am reminded of a lad who was laid in the next
cot to a friend of mine in a public hospital and who was no
sooner installed than he sent out (perhaps with his last pence)
for a cheap Shakespeare.&nbsp; My friend pricked up his ears;
fell at once in talk with his new neighbour, and was ready, when
the book arrived, to make a singular discovery.&nbsp; For this
lover of great literature understood not one sentence out of
twelve, and his favourite part was that of which he understood
the least&mdash;the inimitable, mouth-filling rodomontade of the
ghost in <i>Hamlet</i>.&nbsp; It was a bright day in hospital
when my friend expounded the sense of this beloved jargon: a task
for which I am willing to believe my friend was very fit, though
I can never regard it as an easy one.&nbsp; I know indeed a point
or two, on which I would gladly question Mr. Shakespeare, that
lover of big words, could he revisit the glimpses of the moon, or
could I myself climb backward to the spacious days of
Elizabeth.&nbsp; But in the second case, I should most likely
pretermit these questionings, and take my place instead in the
pit at the Blackfriars, to hear the actor in his favourite part,
playing up to Mr. Burbage, and rolling out&mdash;as I seem to
hear him&mdash;with a ponderous gusto&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Unhousel&rsquo;d, disappointed,
unanel&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a pleasant chance, if we could go there in a party I and
what a surprise for Mr. Burbage, when the ghost received the
honours of the evening!</p>
<p>As for my old soldier, like Mr. Burbage and Mr. Shakespeare,
he is long since dead; and now lies buried, I suppose, and
nameless and quite forgotten, in some poor city
graveyard.&mdash;But not for me, you brave heart, have you been
buried!&nbsp; For me, you are still afoot, tasting the sun and
air, and striding southward.&nbsp; By the groves of Comiston and
beside the Hermitage of Braid, by the Hunters&rsquo; Tryst, and
where the curlews and plovers cry around Fairmilehead, I see and
hear you, stalwartly carrying your deadly sickness, cheerfully
discoursing of uncomprehended poets.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The thought of the old soldier recalls that of another tramp,
his counterpart.&nbsp; This was a little, lean, and fiery man,
with the eyes of a dog and the face of a gipsy; whom I found one
morning encamped with his wife and children and his
grinder&rsquo;s wheel, beside the burn of Kinnaird.&nbsp; To this
beloved dell I went, at that time, daily; and daily the
knife-grinder and I (for as long as his tent continued pleasantly
to interrupt my little wilderness) sat on two stones, and smoked,
and plucked grass, and talked to the tune of the brown
water.&nbsp; His children were mere whelps, they fought and bit
among the fern like vermin.&nbsp; His wife was a mere squaw; I
saw her gather brush and tend the kettle, but she never ventured
to address her lord while I was present.&nbsp; The tent was a
mere gipsy hovel, like a sty for pigs.&nbsp; But the grinder
himself had the fine self-sufficiency and grave politeness of the
hunter and the savage; he did me the honours of this dell, which
had been mine but the day before, took me far into the secrets of
his life, and used me (I am proud to remember) as a friend.</p>
<p>Like my old soldier, he was far gone in the national
complaint.&nbsp; Unlike him, he had a vulgar taste in letters;
scarce flying higher than the story papers; probably finding no
difference, certainly seeking none, between Tannahill and Burns;
his noblest thoughts, whether of poetry or music, adequately
embodied in that somewhat obvious ditty,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Will ye gang, lassie, gang<br />
To the braes o&rsquo; Balquidder.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;which is indeed apt to echo in the ears of Scottish
children, and to him, in view of his experience, must have found
a special directness of address.&nbsp; But if he had no fine
sense of poetry in letters, he felt with a deep joy the poetry of
life.&nbsp; You should have heard him speak of what he loved; of
the tent pitched beside the talking water; of the stars overhead
at night; of the blest return of morning, the peep of day over
the moors, the awaking birds among the birches; how he abhorred
the long winter shut in cities; and with what delight, at the
return of the spring, he once more pitched his camp in the living
out-of-doors.&nbsp; But we were a pair of tramps; and to you, who
are doubtless sedentary and a consistent first-class passenger in
life, he would scarce have laid himself so open;&mdash;to you, he
might have been content to tell his story of a ghost&mdash;that
of a buccaneer with his pistols as he lived&mdash;whom he had
once encountered in a seaside cave near Buckie; and that would
have been enough, for that would have shown you the mettle of the
man.&nbsp; Here was a piece of experience solidly and livingly
built up in words, here was a story created, <i>teres atque
rotundus</i>.</p>
<p>And to think of the old soldier, that lover of the literary
bards!&nbsp; He had visited stranger spots than any seaside cave;
encountered men more terrible than any spirit; done and dared and
suffered in that incredible, unsung epic of the Mutiny War;
played his part with the field force of Delhi, beleaguering and
beleaguered; shared in that enduring, savage anger and contempt
of death and decency that, for long months together,
bedevil&rsquo;d and inspired the army; was hurled to and fro in
the battle-smoke of the assault; was there, perhaps, where
Nicholson fell; was there when the attacking column, with hell
upon every side, found the soldier&rsquo;s enemy&mdash;strong
drink, and the lives of tens of thousands trembled in the scale,
and the fate of the flag of England staggered.&nbsp; And of all
this he had no more to say than &ldquo;hot work, sir,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;the army suffered a great deal, sir,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I
believe General Wilson, sir, was not very highly thought of in
the papers.&rdquo;&nbsp; His life was naught to him, the vivid
pages of experience quite blank: in words his pleasure
lay&mdash;melodious, agitated words&mdash;printed words, about
that which he had never seen and was connatally incapable of
comprehending.&nbsp; We have here two temperaments face to face;
both untrained, unsophisticated, surprised (we may say) in the
egg; both boldly charactered:&mdash;that of the artist, the lover
and artificer of words; that of the maker, the see&euml;r, the
lover and forger of experience.&nbsp; If the one had a daughter
and the other had a son, and these married, might not some
illustrious writer count descent from the beggar-soldier and the
needy knife-grinder?</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Every one lives by selling something, whatever be his right to
it.&nbsp; The burglar sells at the same time his own skill and
courage and my silver plate (the whole at the most moderate
figure) to a Jew receiver.&nbsp; The bandit sells the traveller
an article of prime necessity: that traveller&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;
And as for the old soldier, who stands for central mark to my
capricious figures of eight, he dealt in a specially; for he was
the only beggar in the world who ever gave me pleasure for my
money.&nbsp; He had learned a school of manners in the barracks
and had the sense to cling to it, accosting strangers with a
regimental freedom, thanking patrons with a merely regimental
difference, sparing you at once the tragedy of his position and
the embarrassment of yours.&nbsp; There was not one hint about
him of the beggar&rsquo;s emphasis, the outburst of revolting
gratitude, the rant and cant, the &ldquo;God bless you, Kind,
Kind gentleman,&rdquo; which insults the smallness of your alms
by disproportionate vehemence, which is so notably false, which
would be so unbearable if it were true.&nbsp; I am sometimes
tempted to suppose this reading of the beggar&rsquo;s part, a
survival of the old days when Shakespeare was intoned upon the
stage and mourners keened beside the death-bed; to think that we
cannot now accept these strong emotions unless they be uttered in
the just note of life; nor (save in the pulpit) endure these
gross conventions.&nbsp; They wound us, I am tempted to say, like
mockery; the high voice of keening (as it yet lingers on) strikes
in the face of sorrow like a buffet; and the rant and cant of the
staled beggar stirs in us a shudder of disgust.&nbsp; But the
fact disproves these amateur opinions.&nbsp; The beggar lives by
his knowledge of the average man.&nbsp; He knows what he is about
when he bandages his head, and hires and drugs a babe, and
poisons life with <i>Poor Mary Ann</i> or <i>Long</i>, <i>long
ago</i>; he knows what he is about when he loads the critical ear
and sickens the nice conscience with intolerable thanks; they
know what they are about, he and his crew, when they pervade the
slums of cities, ghastly parodies of suffering, hateful parodies
of gratitude.&nbsp; This trade can scarce be called an
imposition; it has been so blown upon with exposures; it flaunts
its fraudulence so nakedly.&nbsp; We pay them as we pay those who
show us, in huge exaggeration, the monsters of our
drinking-water; or those who daily predict the fall of
Britain.&nbsp; We pay them for the pain they inflict, pay them,
and wince, and hurry on.&nbsp; And truly there is nothing that
can shake the conscience like a beggar&rsquo;s thanks; and that
polity in which such protestations can be purchased for a
shilling, seems no scene for an honest man.</p>
<p>Are there, then, we may be asked, no genuine beggars?&nbsp;
And the answer is, Not one.&nbsp; My old soldier was a humbug
like the rest; his ragged boots were, in the stage phrase,
properties; whole boots were given him again and again, and
always gladly accepted; and the next day, there he was on the
road as usual, with toes exposed.&nbsp; His boots were his
method; they were the man&rsquo;s trade; without his boots he
would have starved; he did not live by charity, but by appealing
to a gross taste in the public, which loves the limelight on the
actor&rsquo;s face, and the toes out of the beggar&rsquo;s
boots.&nbsp; There is a true poverty, which no one sees: a false
and merely mimetic poverty, which usurps its place and dress, and
lives and above all drinks, on the fruits of the
usurpation.&nbsp; The true poverty does not go into the streets;
the banker may rest assured, he has never put a penny in its
hand.&nbsp; The self-respecting poor beg from each other; never
from the rich.&nbsp; To live in the frock-coated ranks of life,
to hear canting scenes of gratitude rehearsed for twopence, a man
might suppose that giving was a thing gone out of fashion; yet it
goes forward on a scale so great as to fill me with
surprise.&nbsp; In the houses of the working class, all day long
there will be a foot upon the stair; all day long there will be a
knocking at the doors; beggars come, beggars go, without stint,
hardly with intermission, from morning till night; and meanwhile,
in the same city and but a few streets off, the castles of the
rich stand unsummoned.&nbsp; Get the tale of any honest tramp,
you will find it was always the poor who helped him; get the
truth from any workman who has met misfortunes, it was always
next door that he would go for help, or only with such exceptions
as are said to prove a rule; look at the course of the mimetic
beggar, it is through the poor quarters that he trails his
passage, showing his bandages to every window, piercing even to
the attics with his nasal song.&nbsp; Here is a remarkable state
of things in our Christian commonwealths, that the poor only
should be asked to give.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>There is a pleasant tale of some worthless, phrasing
Frenchman, who was taxed with ingratitude: &ldquo;<i>Il faut
savoir garder l&rsquo;ind&eacute;pendance du
c&oelig;ur</i>,&rdquo; cried he.&nbsp; I own I feel with
him.&nbsp; Gratitude without familarity, gratitude otherwise than
as a nameless element in a friendship, is a thing so near to
hatred that I do not care to split the difference.&nbsp; Until I
find a man who is pleased to receive obligations, I shall
continue to question the tact of those who are eager to confer
them.&nbsp; What an art it is, to give, even to our nearest
friends! and what a test of manners, to receive!&nbsp; How, upon
either side, we smuggle away the obligation, blushing for each
other; how bluff and dull we make the giver; how hasty, how
falsely cheerful, the receiver!&nbsp; And yet an act of such
difficulty and distress between near friends, it is supposed we
can perform to a total stranger and leave the man transfixed with
grateful emotions.&nbsp; The last thing you can do to a man is to
burthen him with an obligation, and it is what we propose to
begin with!&nbsp; But let us not be deceived: unless he is
totally degraded to his trade, anger jars in his inside, and he
grates his teeth at our gratuity.</p>
<p>We should wipe two words from our vocabulary: gratitude and
charity.&nbsp; In real life, help is given out of friendship, or
it is not valued; it is received from the hand of friendship, or
it is resented.&nbsp; We are all too proud to take a naked gift:
we must seem to pay it, if in nothing else, then with the
delights of our society.&nbsp; Here, then, is the pitiful fix of
the rich man; here is that needle&rsquo;s eye in which he stuck
already in the days of Christ, and still sticks to-day, firmer,
if possible, than ever: that he has the money and lacks the love
which should make his money acceptable.&nbsp; Here and now, just
as of old in Palestine, he has the rich to dinner, it is with the
rich that he takes his pleasure: and when his turn comes to be
charitable, he looks in vain for a recipient.&nbsp; His friends
are not poor, they do not want; the poor are not his friends,
they will not take.&nbsp; To whom is he to give?&nbsp; Where to
find&mdash;note this phase&mdash;the Deserving Poor?&nbsp;
Charity is (what they call) centralised; offices are hired;
societies founded, with secretaries paid or unpaid: the hunt of
the Deserving Poor goes merrily forward.&nbsp; I think it will
take more than a merely human secretary to disinter that
character.&nbsp; What! a class that is to be in want from no
fault of its own, and yet greedily eager to receive from
strangers; and to be quite respectable, and at the same time
quite devoid of self-respect; and play the most delicate part of
friendship, and yet never be seen; and wear the form of man, and
yet fly in the face of all the laws of human nature:&mdash;and
all this, in the hope of getting a belly-god Burgess through a
needle&rsquo;s eye!&nbsp; O, let him stick, by all means: and let
his polity tumble in the dust; and let his epitaph and all his
literature (of which my own works begin to form no inconsiderable
part) be abolished even from the history of man!&nbsp; For a fool
of this monstrosity of dulness, there can be no salvation: and
the fool who looked for the elixir of life was an angel of reason
to the fool who looks for the Deserving Poor!</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>And yet there is one course which the unfortunate gentleman
may take.&nbsp; He may subscribe to pay the taxes.&nbsp; There
were the true charity, impartial and impersonal, cumbering none
with obligation, helping all.&nbsp; There were a destination for
loveless gifts; there were the way to reach the pocket of the
deserving poor, and yet save the time of secretaries!&nbsp; But,
alas! there is no colour of romance in such a course; and people
nowhere demand the picturesque so much as in their virtues.</p>

LETTER TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO PROPOSES TO EMBRACE THE CAREER OF
ART</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the agreeable frankness of
youth, you address me on a point of some practical importance to
yourself and (it is even conceivable) of some gravity to the
world: Should you or should you not become an artist?&nbsp; It is
one which you must decide entirely for yourself; all that I can
do is to bring under your notice some of the materials of that
decision; and I will begin, as I shall probably conclude also, by
assuring you that all depends on the vocation.</p>
<p>To know what you like is the beginning of wisdom and of old
age.&nbsp; Youth is wholly experimental.&nbsp; The essence and
charm of that unquiet and delightful epoch is ignorance of self
as well as ignorance of life.&nbsp; These two unknowns the young
man brings together again and again, now in the airiest touch,
now with a bitter hug; now with exquisite pleasure, now with
cutting pain; but never with indifference, to which he is a total
stranger, and never with that near kinsman of indifference,
contentment.&nbsp; If he be a youth of dainty senses or a brain
easily heated, the interest of this series of experiments grows
upon him out of all proportion to the pleasure he receives.&nbsp;
It is not beauty that he loves, nor pleasure that he seeks,
though he may think so; his design and his sufficient reward is
to verify his own existence and taste the variety of human
fate.&nbsp; To him, before the razor-edge of curiosity is dulled,
all that is not actual living and the hot chase of experience
wears a face of a disgusting dryness difficult to recall in later
days; or if there be any exception&mdash;and here destiny steps
in&mdash;it is in those moments when, wearied or surfeited of the
primary activity of the senses, he calls up before memory the
image of transacted pains and pleasures.&nbsp; Thus it is that
such an one shies from all cut-and-dry professions, and inclines
insensibly toward that career of art which consists only in the
tasting and recording of experience.</p>
<p>This, which is not so much a vocation for art as an impatience
of all other honest trades, frequently exists alone; and so
existing, it will pass gently away in the course of years.&nbsp;
Emphatically, it is not to be regarded; it is not a vocation, but
a temptation; and when your father the other day so fiercely and
(in my view) so properly discouraged your ambition, he was
recalling not improbably some similar passage in his own
experience.&nbsp; For the temptation is perhaps nearly as common
as the vocation is rare.&nbsp; But again we have vocations which
are imperfect; we have men whose minds are bound up, not so much
in any art, as in the general <i>ars artium</i> and common base
of all creative work; who will now dip into painting, and now
study counterpoint, and anon will be inditing a sonnet: all these
with equal interest, all often with genuine knowledge.&nbsp; And
of this temper, when it stands alone, I find it difficult to
speak; but I should counsel such an one to take to letters, for
in literature (which drags with so wide a net) all his
information may be found some day useful, and if he should go on
as he has begun, and turn at last into the critic, he will have
learned to use the necessary tools.&nbsp; Lastly we come to those
vocations which are at once decisive and precise; to the men who
are born with the love of pigments, the passion of drawing, the
gift of music, or the impulse to create with words, just as other
and perhaps the same men are born with the love of hunting, or
the sea, or horses, or the turning-lathe.&nbsp; These are
predestined; if a man love the labour of any trade, apart from
any question of success or fame, the gods have called him.&nbsp;
He may have the general vocation too: he may have a taste for all
the arts, and I think he often has; but the mark of his calling
is this laborious partiality for one, this inextinguishable zest
in its technical successes, and (perhaps above all) a certain
candour of mind to take his very trifling enterprise with a
gravity that would befit the cares of empire, and to think the
smallest improvement worth accomplishing at any expense of time
and industry.&nbsp; The book, the statue, the sonata, must be
gone upon with the unreasoning good faith and the unflagging
spirit of children at their play.&nbsp; <i>Is it worth
doing</i>?&mdash;when it shall have occurred to any artist to ask
himself that question, it is implicitly answered in the
negative.&nbsp; It does not occur to the child as he plays at
being a pirate on the dining-room sofa, nor to the hunter as he
pursues his quarry; and the candour of the one and the ardour of
the other should be united in the bosom of the artist.</p>
<p>If you recognise in yourself some such decisive taste, there
is no room for hesitation: follow your bent.&nbsp; And observe
(lest I should too much discourage you) that the disposition does
not usually burn so brightly at the first, or rather not so
constantly.&nbsp; Habit and practice sharpen gifts; the necessity
of toil grows less disgusting, grows even welcome, in the course
of years; a small taste (if it be only genuine) waxes with
indulgence into an exclusive passion.&nbsp; Enough, just now, if
you can look back over a fair interval, and see that your chosen
art has a little more than held its own among the thronging
interests of youth.&nbsp; Time will do the rest, if devotion help
it; and soon your every thought will be engrossed in that beloved
occupation.</p>
<p>But even with devotion, you may remind me, even with
unfaltering and delighted industry, many thousand artists spend
their lives, if the result be regarded, utterly in vain: a
thousand artists, and never one work of art.&nbsp; But the vast
mass of mankind are incapable of doing anything reasonably well,
art among the rest.&nbsp; The worthless artist would not
improbably have been a quite incompetent baker.&nbsp; And the
artist, even if he does not amuse the public, amuses himself; so
that there will always be one man the happier for his
vigils.&nbsp; This is the practical side of art: its inexpugnable
fortress for the true practitioner.&nbsp; The direct
returns&mdash;the wages of the trade are small, but the
indirect&mdash;the wages of the life&mdash;are incalculably
great.&nbsp; No other business offers a man his daily bread upon
such joyful terms.&nbsp; The soldier and the explorer have
moments of a worthier excitement, but they are purchased by cruel
hardships and periods of tedium that beggar language.&nbsp; In
the life of the artist there need be no hour without its
pleasure.&nbsp; I take the author, with whose career I am best
acquainted; and it is true he works in a rebellious material, and
that the act of writing is cramped and trying both to the eyes
and the temper; but remark him in his study, when matter crowds
upon him and words are not wanting&mdash;in what a continual
series of small successes time flows by; with what a sense of
power as of one moving mountains, he marshals his petty
characters; with what pleasures, both of the ear and eye, he sees
his airy structure growing on the page; and how he labours in a
craft to which the whole material of his life is tributary, and
which opens a door to all his tastes, his loves, his hatreds, and
his convictions, so that what he writes is only what he longed to
utter.&nbsp; He may have enjoyed many things in this big, tragic
playground of the world; but what shall he have enjoyed more
fully than a morning of successful work?&nbsp; Suppose it ill
paid: the wonder is it should be paid at all.&nbsp; Other men
pay, and pay dearly, for pleasures less desirable.</p>
<p>Nor will the practice of art afford you pleasure only; it
affords besides an admirable training.&nbsp; For the artist works
entirely upon honour.&nbsp; The public knows little or nothing of
those merits in the quest of which you are condemned to spend the
bulk of your endeavours.&nbsp; Merits of design, the merit of
first-hand energy, the merit of a certain cheap accomplishment
which a man of the artistic temper easily acquires&mdash;these
they can recognise, and these they value.&nbsp; But to those more
exquisite refinements of proficiency and finish, which the artist
so ardently desires and so keenly feels, for which (in the
vigorous words of Balzac) he must toil &ldquo;like a miner buried
in a landslip,&rdquo; for which, day after day, he recasts and
revises and rejects&mdash;the gross mass of the public must be
ever blind.&nbsp; To those lost pains, suppose you attain the
highest pitch of merit, posterity may possibly do justice;
suppose, as is so probable, you fall by even a hair&rsquo;s
breadth of the highest, rest certain they shall never be
observed.&nbsp; Under the shadow of this cold thought, alone in
his studio, the artist must preserve from day to day his
constancy to the ideal.&nbsp; It is this which makes his life
noble; it is by this that the practice of his craft strengthens
and matures his character; it is for this that even the serious
countenance of the great emperor was turned approvingly (if only
for a moment) on the followers of Apollo, and that sternly gentle
voice bade the artist cherish his art.</p>
<p>And here there fall two warnings to be made.&nbsp; First, if
you are to continue to be a law to yourself, you must beware of
the first signs of laziness.&nbsp; This idealism in honesty can
only be supported by perpetual effort; the standard is easily
lowered, the artist who says &ldquo;<i>It will do</i>,&rdquo; is
on the downward path; three or four pot-boilers are enough at
times (above all at wrong times) to falsify a talent, and by the
practice of journalism a man runs the risk of becoming wedded to
cheap finish.&nbsp; This is the danger on the one side; there is
not less upon the other.&nbsp; The consciousness of how much the
artist is (and must be) a law to himself, debauches the small
heads.&nbsp; Perceiving recondite merits very hard to attain,
making or swallowing artistic formul&aelig;, or perhaps falling
in love with some particular proficiency of his own, many artists
forget the end of all art: to please.&nbsp; It is doubtless
tempting to exclaim against the ignorant bourgeois; yet it should
not be forgotten, it is he who is to pay us, and that (surely on
the face of it) for services that he shall desire to have
performed.&nbsp; Here also, if properly considered, there is a
question of transcendental honesty.&nbsp; To give the public what
they do not want, and yet expect to be supported: we have there a
strange pretension, and yet not uncommon, above all with
painters.&nbsp; The first duty in this world is for a man to pay
his way; when that is quite accomplished, he may plunge into what
eccentricity he likes; but emphatically not till then.&nbsp; Till
then, he must pay assiduous court to the bourgeois who carries
the purse.&nbsp; And if in the course of these capitulations he
shall falsify his talent, it can never have been a strong one,
and he will have preserved a better thing than
talent&mdash;character.&nbsp; Or if he be of a mind so
independent that he cannot stoop to this necessity, one course is
yet open: he can desist from art, and follow some more manly way
of life.</p>
<p>I speak of a more manly way of life, it is a point on which I
must be frank.&nbsp; To live by a pleasure is not a high calling;
it involves patronage, however veiled; it numbers the artist,
however ambitious, along with dancing girls and billiard
markers.&nbsp; The French have a romantic evasion for one
employment, and call its practitioners the Daughters of
Joy.&nbsp; The artist is of the same family, he is of the Sons of
Joy, chose his trade to please himself, gains his livelihood by
pleasing others, and has parted with something of the sterner
dignity of man.&nbsp; Journals but a little while ago declaimed
against the Tennyson peerage; and this Son of Joy was blamed for
condescension when he followed the example of Lord Lawrence and
Lord Cairns and Lord Clyde.&nbsp; The poet was more happily
inspired; with a better modesty he accepted the honour; and
anonymous journalists have not yet (if I am to believe them)
recovered the vicarious disgrace to their profession.&nbsp; When
it comes to their turn, these gentlemen can do themselves more
justice; and I shall be glad to think of it; for to my barbarian
eyesight, even Lord Tennyson looks somewhat out of place in that
assembly.&nbsp; There should be no honours for the artist; he has
already, in the practice of his art, more than his share of the
rewards of life; the honours are pre-empted for other trades,
less agreeable and perhaps more useful.</p>
<p>But the devil in these trades of pleasing is to fail to
please.&nbsp; In ordinary occupations, a man offers to do a
certain thing or to produce a certain article with a merely
conventional accomplishment, a design in which (we may almost
say) it is difficult to fail.&nbsp; But the artist steps forth
out of the crowd and proposes to delight: an impudent design, in
which it is impossible to fail without odious
circumstances.&nbsp; The poor Daughter of Joy, carrying her
smiles and finery quite unregarded through the crowd, makes a
figure which it is impossible to recall without a wounding
pity.&nbsp; She is the type of the unsuccessful artist.&nbsp; The
actor, the dancer, and the singer must appear like her in person,
and drain publicly the cup of failure.&nbsp; But though the rest
of us escape this crowning bitterness of the pillory, we all
court in essence the same humiliation.&nbsp; We all profess to be
able to delight.&nbsp; And how few of us are!&nbsp; We all pledge
ourselves to be able to continue to delight.&nbsp; And the day
will come to each, and even to the most admired, when the ardour
shall have declined and the cunning shall be lost, and he shall
sit by his deserted booth ashamed.&nbsp; Then shall he see
himself condemned to do work for which he blushes to take
payment.&nbsp; Then (as if his lot were not already cruel) he
must lie exposed to the gibes of the wreckers of the press, who
earn a little bitter bread by the condemnation of trash which
they have not read, and the praise of excellence which they
cannot understand.</p>
<p>And observe that this seems almost the necessary end at least
of writers.&nbsp; <i>Les blancs et les Bleus</i> (for instance)
is of an order of merit very different from <i>Le Vicomte de
Braglonne</i>; and if any gentleman can bear to spy upon the
nakedness of <i>Castle Dangerous</i>, his name I think is Ham:
let it be enough for the rest of us to read of it (not without
tears) in the pages of Lockhart.&nbsp; Thus in old age, when
occupation and comfort are most needful, the writer must lay
aside at once his pastime and his breadwinner.&nbsp; The painter
indeed, if he succeed at all in engaging the attention of the
public, gains great sums and can stand to his easel until a great
age without dishonourable failure.&nbsp; The writer has the
double misfortune to be ill-paid while he can work, and to be
incapable of working when he is old.&nbsp; It is thus a way of
life which conducts directly to a false position.</p>
<p>For the writer (in spite of notorious examples to the
contrary) must look to be ill-paid.&nbsp; Tennyson and
Mont&eacute;pin make handsome livelihoods; but we cannot all hope
to be Tennyson, and we do not all perhaps desire to be
Mont&eacute;pin.&nbsp; If you adopt an art to be your trade, weed
your mind at the outset of all desire of money.&nbsp; What you
may decently expect, if you have some talent and much industry,
is such an income as a clerk will earn with a tenth or perhaps a
twentieth of your nervous output.&nbsp; Nor have you the right to
look for more; in the wages of the life, not in the wages of the
trade, lies your reward; the work is here the wages.&nbsp; It
will be seen I have little sympathy with the common lamentations
of the artist class.&nbsp; Perhaps they do not remember the hire
of the field labourer; or do they think no parallel will
lie?&nbsp; Perhaps they have never observed what is the retiring
allowance of a field officer; or do they suppose their
contributions to the arts of pleasing more important than the
services of a colonel?&nbsp; Perhaps they forget on how little
Millet was content to live; or do they think, because they have
less genius, they stand excused from the display of equal
virtues?&nbsp; But upon one point there should be no dubiety: if
a man be not frugal, he has no business in the arts.&nbsp; If he
be not frugal, he steers directly for that last tragic scene of
<i>le vieux saltimbanque</i>; if he be not frugal, he will find
it hard to continue to be honest.&nbsp; Some day, when the
butcher is knocking at the door, he may be tempted, he may be
obliged, to turn out and sell a slovenly piece of work.&nbsp; If
the obligation shall have arisen through no wantonness of his
own, he is even to be commanded; for words cannot describe how
far more necessary it is that a man should support his family,
than that he should attain to&mdash;or preserve&mdash;distinction
in the arts.&nbsp; But if the pressure comes, through his own
fault, he has stolen, and stolen under trust, and stolen (which
is the worst of all) in such a way that no law can reach him.</p>
<p>And now you may perhaps ask me, if the d&eacute;butant artist
is to have no thought of money, and if (as is implied) he is to
expect no honours from the State, he may not at least look
forward to the delights of popularity?&nbsp; Praise, you will
tell me, is a savoury dish.&nbsp; And in so far as you may mean
the countenance of other artists you would put your finger on one
of the most essential and enduring pleasures of the career of
art.&nbsp; But in so far as you should have an eye to the
commendations of the public or the notice of the newspapers, be
sure you would but be cherishing a dream.&nbsp; It is true that
in certain esoteric journals the author (for instance) is duly
criticised, and that he is often praised a great deal more than
he deserves, sometimes for qualities which he prided himself on
eschewing, and sometimes by ladies and gentlemen who have denied
themselves the privilege of reading his work.&nbsp; But if a man
be sensitive to this wild praise, we must suppose him equally
alive to that which often accompanies and always follows
it&mdash;wild ridicule.&nbsp; A man may have done well for years,
and then he may fail; he will hear of his failure.&nbsp; Or he
may have done well for years, and still do well, but the critics
may have tired of praising him, or there may have sprung up some
new idol of the instant, some &ldquo;dust a little gilt,&rdquo;
to whom they now prefer to offer sacrifice.&nbsp; Here is the
obverse and the reverse of that empty and ugly thing called
popularity.&nbsp; Will any man suppose it worth the gaining?</p>

PULVIS ET UMBRA</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> look for some reward of our
endeavours and are disappointed; not success, not happiness, not
even peace of conscience, crowns our ineffectual efforts to do
well.&nbsp; Our frailties are invincible, our virtues barren; the
battle goes sore against us to the going down of the sun.&nbsp;
The canting moralist tells us of right and wrong; and we look
abroad, even on the face of our small earth, and find them change
with every climate, and no country where some action is not
honoured for a virtue and none where it is not branded for a
vice; and we look in our experience, and find no vital congruity
in the wisest rules, but at the best a municipal fitness.&nbsp;
It is not strange if we are tempted to despair of good.&nbsp; We
ask too much.&nbsp; Our religions and moralities have been
trimmed to flatter us, till they are all emasculate and
sentimentalised, and only please and weaken.&nbsp; Truth is of a
rougher strain.&nbsp; In the harsh face of life, faith can read a
bracing gospel.&nbsp; The human race is a thing more ancient than
the ten commandments; and the bones and revolutions of the
Kosmos, in whose joints we are but moss and fungus, more ancient
still.</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Of the Kosmos in the last resort, science reports many
doubtful things and all of them appalling.&nbsp; There seems no
substance to this solid globe on which we stamp: nothing but
symbols and ratios.&nbsp; Symbols and ratios carry us and bring
us forth and beat us down; gravity that swings the
incommensurable suns and worlds through space, is but a figment
varying inversely as the squares of distances; and the suns and
worlds themselves, imponderable figures of abstraction,
NH<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O.&nbsp; Consideration dares not
dwell upon this view; that way madness lies; science carries us
into zones of speculation, where there is no habitable city for
the mind of man.</p>
<p>But take the Kosmos with a grosser faith, as our senses give
it us.&nbsp; We behold space sown with rotatory islands, suns and
worlds and the shards and wrecks of systems: some, like the sun,
still blazing; some rotting, like the earth; others, like the
moon, stable in desolation.&nbsp; All of these we take to be made
of something we call matter: a thing which no analysis can help
us to conceive; to whose incredible properties no familiarity can
reconcile our minds.&nbsp; This stuff, when not purified by the
lustration of fire, rots uncleanly into something we call life;
seized through all its atoms with a pediculous malady; swelling
in tumours that become independent, sometimes even (by an
abhorrent prodigy) locomotory; one splitting into millions,
millions cohering into one, as the malady proceeds through
varying stages.&nbsp; This vital putrescence of the dust, used as
we are to it, yet strikes us with occasional disgust, and the
profusion of worms in a piece of ancient turf, or the air of a
marsh darkened with insects, will sometimes check our breathing
so that we aspire for cleaner places.&nbsp; But none is clean:
the moving sand is infected with lice; the pure spring, where it
bursts out of the mountain, is a mere issue of worms; even in the
hard rock the crystal is forming.</p>
<p>In two main shapes this eruption covers the countenance of the
earth: the animal and the vegetable: one in some degree the
inversion of the other: the second rooted to the spot; the first
coming detached out of its natal mud, and scurrying abroad with
the myriad feet of insects or towering into the heavens on the
wings of birds: a thing so inconceivable that, if it be well
considered, the heart stops.&nbsp; To what passes with the
anchored vermin, we have little clue, doubtless they have their
joys and sorrows, their delights and killing agonies: it appears
not how.&nbsp; But of the locomotory, to which we ourselves
belong, we can tell more.&nbsp; These share with us a thousand
miracles: the miracles of sight, of hearing, of the projection of
sound, things that bridge space; the miracles of memory and
reason, by which the present is conceived, and when it is gone,
its image kept living in the brains of man and brute; the miracle
of reproduction, with its imperious desires and staggering
consequences.&nbsp; And to put the last touch upon this mountain
mass of the revolting and the inconceivable, all these prey upon
each other, lives tearing other lives in pieces, cramming them
inside themselves, and by that summary process, growing fat: the
vegetarian, the whale, perhaps the tree, not less than the lion
of the desert; for the vegetarian is only the eater of the
dumb.</p>
<p>Meanwhile our rotatory island loaded with predatory life, and
more drenched with blood, both animal and vegetable, than ever
mutinied ship, scuds through space with unimaginable speed, and
turns alternate cheeks to the reverberation of a blazing world,
ninety million miles away.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>What a monstrous spectre is this man, the disease of the
agglutinated dust, lifting alternate feet or lying drugged with
slumber; killing, feeding, growing, bringing forth small copies
of himself; grown upon with hair like grass, fitted with eyes
that move and glitter in his face; a thing to set children
screaming;&mdash;and yet looked at nearlier, known as his fellows
know him, how surprising are his attributes!&nbsp; Poor soul,
here for so little, cast among so many hardships, filled with
desires so incommensurate and so inconsistent, savagely
surrounded, savagely descended, irremediably condemned to prey
upon his fellow lives: who should have blamed him had he been of
a piece with his destiny and a being merely barbarous?&nbsp; And
we look and behold him instead filled with imperfect virtues:
infinitely childish, often admirably valiant, often touchingly
kind; sitting down, amidst his momentary life, to debate of right
and wrong and the attributes of the deity; rising up to do battle
for an egg or die for an idea; singling out his friends and his
mate with cordial affection; bringing forth in pain, rearing with
long-suffering solicitude, his young.&nbsp; To touch the heart of
his mystery, we find, in him one thought, strange to the point of
lunacy: the thought of duty; the thought of something owing to
himself, to his neighbour, to his God: an ideal of decency, to
which he would rise if it were possible; a limit of shame, below
which, if it be possible, he will not stoop.&nbsp; The design in
most men is one of conformity; here and there, in picked natures,
it transcends itself and soars on the other side, arming martyrs
with independence; but in all, in their degrees, it is a bosom
thought:&mdash;Not in man alone, for we trace it in dogs and cats
whom we know fairly well, and doubtless some similar point of
honour sways the elephant, the oyster, and the louse, of whom we
know so little:&mdash;But in man, at least, it sways with so
complete an empire that merely selfish things come second, even
with the selfish: that appetites are starved, fears are
conquered, pains supported; that almost the dullest shrinks from
the reproof of a glance, although it were a child&rsquo;s; and
all but the most cowardly stand amid the risks of war; and the
more noble, having strongly conceived an act as due to their
ideal, affront and embrace death.&nbsp; Strange enough if, with
their singular origin and perverted practice, they think they are
to be rewarded in some future life: stranger still, if they are
persuaded of the contrary, and think this blow, which they
solicit, will strike them senseless for eternity.&nbsp; I shall
be reminded what a tragedy of misconception and misconduct man at
large presents: of organised injustice, cowardly violence and
treacherous crime; and of the damning imperfections of the
best.&nbsp; They cannot be too darkly drawn.&nbsp; Man is indeed
marked for failure in his efforts to do right.&nbsp; But where
the best consistently miscarry, how tenfold more remarkable that
all should continue to strive; and surely we should find it both
touching and inspiriting, that in a field from which success is
banished, our race should not cease to labour.</p>
<p>If the first view of this creature, stalking in his rotatory
isle, be a thing to shake the courage of the stoutest, on this
nearer sight, he startles us with an admiring wonder.&nbsp; It
matters not where we look, under what climate we observe him, in
what stage of society, in what depth of ignorance, burthened with
what erroneous morality; by camp-fires in Assiniboia, the snow
powdering his shoulders, the wind plucking his blanket, as he
sits, passing the ceremonial calumet and uttering his grave
opinions like a Roman senator; in ships at sea, a man inured to
hardship and vile pleasures, his brightest hope a fiddle in a
tavern and a bedizened trull who sells herself to rob him, and he
for all that simple, innocent, cheerful, kindly like a child,
constant to toil, brave to drown, for others; in the slums of
cities, moving among indifferent millions to mechanical
employments, without hope of change in the future, with scarce a
pleasure in the present, and yet true to his virtues, honest up
to his lights, kind to his neighbours, tempted perhaps in vain by
the bright gin-palace, perhaps long-suffering with the drunken
wife that ruins him; in India (a woman this time) kneeling with
broken cries and streaming tears, as she drowns her child in the
sacred river; in the brothel, the discard of society, living
mainly on strong drink, fed with affronts, a fool, a thief, the
comrade of thieves, and even here keeping the point of honour and
the touch of pity, often repaying the world&rsquo;s scorn with
service, often standing firm upon a scruple, and at a certain
cost, rejecting riches:&mdash;everywhere some virtue cherished or
affected, everywhere some decency of thought and carriage,
everywhere the ensign of man&rsquo;s ineffectual
goodness:&mdash;ah! if I could show you this! if I could show you
these men and women, all the world over, in every stage of
history, under every abuse of error, under every circumstance of
failure, without hope, without help, without thanks, still
obscurely fighting the lost fight of virtue, still clinging, in
the brothel or on the scaffold, to some rag of honour, the poor
jewel of their souls!&nbsp; They may seek to escape, and yet they
cannot; it is not alone their privilege and glory, but their
doom; they are condemned to some nobility; all their lives long,
the desire of good is at their heels, the implacable hunter.</p>
<p>Of all earth&rsquo;s meteors, here at least is the most
strange and consoling: that this ennobled lemur, this
hair-crowned bubble of the dust, this inheritor of a few years
and sorrows, should yet deny himself his rare delights, and add
to his frequent pains, and live for an ideal, however
misconceived.&nbsp; Nor can we stop with man.&nbsp; A new
doctrine, received with screams a little while ago by canting
moralists, and still not properly worked into the body of our
thoughts, lights us a step farther into the heart of this rough
but noble universe.&nbsp; For nowadays the pride of man denies in
vain his kinship with the original dust.&nbsp; He stands no
longer like a thing apart.&nbsp; Close at his heels we see the
dog, prince of another genus: and in him too, we see dumbly
testified the same cultus of an unattainable ideal, the same
constancy in failure.&nbsp; Does it stop with the dog?&nbsp; We
look at our feet where the ground is blackened with the swarming
ant: a creature so small, so far from us in the hierarchy of
brutes, that we can scarce trace and scarce comprehend his
doings; and here also, in his ordered politics and rigorous
justice, we see confessed the law of duty and the fact of
individual sin.&nbsp; Does it stop, then, with the ant?&nbsp;
Rather this desire of well-doing and this doom of frailty run
through all the grades of life: rather is this earth, from the
frosty top of Everest to the next margin of the internal fire,
one stage of ineffectual virtues and one temple of pious tears
and perseverance.&nbsp; The whole creation groaneth and
travaileth together.&nbsp; It is the common and the god-like law
of life.&nbsp; The browsers, the biters, the barkers, the hairy
coats of field and forest, the squirrel in the oak, the
thousand-footed creeper in the dust, as they share with us the
gift of life, share with us the love of an ideal: strive like
us&mdash;like us are tempted to grow weary of the
struggle&mdash;to do well; like us receive at times unmerited
refreshment, visitings of support, returns of courage; and are
condemned like us to be crucified between that double law of the
members and the will.&nbsp; Are they like us, I wonder, in the
timid hope of some reward, some sugar with the drug? do they,
too, stand aghast at unrewarded virtues, at the sufferings of
those whom, in our partiality, we take to be just, and the
prosperity of such as, in our blindness, we call wicked?&nbsp; It
may be, and yet God knows what they should look for.&nbsp; Even
while they look, even while they repent, the foot of man treads
them by thousands in the dust, the yelping hounds burst upon
their trail, the bullet speeds, the knives are heating in the den
of the vivisectionist; or the dew falls, and the generation of a
day is blotted out.&nbsp; For these are creatures, compared with
whom our weakness is strength, our ignorance wisdom, our brief
span eternity.</p>
<p>And as we dwell, we living things, in our isle of terror and
under the imminent hand of death, God forbid it should be man the
erected, the reasoner, the wise in his own eyes&mdash;God forbid
it should be man that wearies in well-doing, that despairs of
unrewarded effort, or utters the language of complaint.&nbsp; Let
it be enough for faith, that the whole creation groans in mortal
frailty, strives with unconquerable constancy: Surely not all in
vain.</p>

A CHRISTMAS SERMON</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the time this paper appears, I
shall have been talking for twelve months; <a
name="citation202"></a><a href="#footnote202"
class="citation">[202]</a> and it is thought I should take my
leave in a formal and seasonable manner.&nbsp; Valedictory
eloquence is rare, and death-bed sayings have not often hit the
mark of the occasion.&nbsp; Charles Second, wit and sceptic, a
man whose life had been one long lesson in human incredulity, an
easy-going comrade, a manoeuvring king&mdash;remembered and
embodied all his wit and scepticism along with more than his
usual good humour in the famous &ldquo;I am afraid, gentlemen, I
am an unconscionable time a-dying.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>An unconscionable time a-dying&mdash;there is the picture
(&ldquo;I am afraid, gentlemen,&rdquo;) of your life and of
mine.&nbsp; The sands run out, and the hours are &ldquo;numbered
and imputed,&rdquo; and the days go by; and when the last of
these finds us, we have been a long time dying, and what
else?&nbsp; The very length is something, if we reach that hour
of separation undishonoured; and to have lived at all is
doubtless (in the soldierly expression) to have served.&nbsp;
There is a tale in Ticitus of how the veterans mutinied in the
German wilderness; of how they mobbed Germanicus, clamouing go
home; and of how, seizing their general&rsquo;s hand, these old,
war-worn exiles passed his finger along their toothless
gums.&nbsp; <i>Sunt lacrym&aelig; rerum</i>: this was the most
eloquent of the songs of Simeon.&nbsp; And when a man has lived
to a fair age, he bears his marks of service.&nbsp; He may have
never been remarked upon the breach at the head of the army; at
least he shall have lost his teeth on the camp bread.</p>
<p>The idealism of serious people in this age of ours is of a
noble character.&nbsp; It never seems to them that they have
served enough; they have a fine impatience of their
virtues.&nbsp; It were perhaps more modest to be singly thankful
that we are no worse.&nbsp; It is not only our enemies, those
desperate characters&mdash;it is we ourselves who know not what
we do,&mdash;thence springs the glimmering hope that perhaps we
do better than we think: that to scramble through this random
business with hands reasonably clean to have played the part of a
man or woman with some reasonable fulness, to have often resisted
the diabolic, and at the end to be still resisting it, is for the
poor human soldier to have done right well.&nbsp; To ask to see
some fruit of our endeavour is but a transcendental way of
serving for reward; and what we take to be contempt of self is
only greed of hire.</p>
<p>And again if we require so much of ourselves, shall we not
require much of others?&nbsp; If we do not genially judge our own
deficiencies, is it not to be feared we shall be even stern to
the trespasses of others?&nbsp; And he who (looking back upon his
own life) can see no more than that he has been unconscionably
long a-dying, will he not be tempted to think his neighbour
unconscionably long of getting hanged?&nbsp; It is probable that
nearly all who think of conduct at all, think of it too much; it
is certain we all think too much of sin.&nbsp; We are not damned
for doing wrong, but for not doing right; Christ would never hear
of negative morality; <i>thou shalt</i> was ever his word, with
which he superseded <i>thou shalt not</i>.&nbsp; To make our idea
of morality centre on forbidden acts is to defile the imagination
and to introduce into our judgments of our fellow-men a secret
element of gusto.&nbsp; If a thing is wrong for us, we should not
dwell upon the thought of it; or we shall soon dwell upon it with
inverted pleasure.&nbsp; If we cannot drive it from our
minds&mdash;one thing of two: either our creed is in the wrong
and we must more indulgently remodel it; or else, if our morality
be in the right, we are criminal lunatics and should place our
persons in restraint.&nbsp; A mark of such unwholesomely divided
minds is the passion for interference with others: the Fox
without the Tail was of this breed, but had (if his biographer is
to be trusted) a certain antique civility now out of date.&nbsp;
A man may have a flaw, a weakness, that unfits him for the duties
of life, that spoils his temper, that threatens his integrity, or
that betrays him into cruelty.&nbsp; It has to be conquered; but
it must never he suffered to engross his thoughts.&nbsp; The true
duties lie all upon the farther side, and must be attended to
with a whole mind so soon as this preliminary clearing of the
decks has been effected.&nbsp; In order that he may be kind and
honest, it may be needful he should become a total abstainer; let
him become so then, and the next day let him forget the
circumstance.&nbsp; Trying to be kind and honest will require all
his thoughts; a mortified appetite is never a wise companion; in
so far as he has had to mortify an appetite, he will still be the
worse man; and of such an one a great deal of cheerfulness will
be required in judging life, and a great deal of humility in
judging others.</p>
<p>It may be argued again that dissatisfaction with our
life&rsquo;s endeavour springs in some degree from dulness.&nbsp;
We require higher tasks, because we do not recognise the height
of those we have.&nbsp; Trying to be kind and honest seems an
affair too simple and too inconsequential for gentlemen of our
heroic mould; we had rather set ourselves to something bold,
arduous, and conclusive; we had rather found a schism or suppress
a heresy, cut off a hand or mortify an appetite.&nbsp; But the
task before us, which is to co-endure with our existence, is
rather one of microscopic fineness, and the heroism required is
that of patience.&nbsp; There is no cutting of the Gordian knots
of life; each must be smilingly unravelled.</p>
<p>To be honest, to be kind&mdash;to earn a little and to spend a
little less, to make upon the whole a family happier for his
presence, to renounce when that shall be necessary and not be
embittered, to keep a few friends, but these without
capitulation&mdash;above all, on the same grim condition, to keep
friends with himself&mdash;here is a task for all that a man has
of fortitude and delicacy.&nbsp; He has an ambitious soul who
would ask more; he has a hopeful spirit who should look in such
an enterprise to be successful.&nbsp; There is indeed one element
in human destiny that not blindness itself can controvert:
whatever else we are intended to do, we are not intended to
succeed; failure is the fate allotted.&nbsp; It is so in every
art and study; it is so above all in the continent art of living
well.&nbsp; Here is a pleasant thought for the year&rsquo;s end
or for the end of life.&nbsp; Only self-deception will be
satisfied, and there need be no despair for the despairer.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>But Christmas is not only the mile-mark of another year,
moving us to thoughts of self-examination: it is a season, from
all its associations, whether domestic or religious, suggesting
thoughts of joy.&nbsp; A man dissatisfied with his endeavours is
a man tempted to sadness.&nbsp; And in the midst of the winter,
when his life runs lowest and he is reminded of the empty chairs
of his beloved, it is well he should be condemned to this fashion
of the smiling face.&nbsp; Noble disappointment, noble
self-denial, are not to be admired, not even to be pardoned, if
they bring bitterness.&nbsp; It is one thing to enter the kingdom
of heaven maim; another to maim yourself and stay without.&nbsp;
And the kingdom of heaven is of the child-like, of those who are
easy to please, who love and who give pleasure.&nbsp; Mighty men
of their hands, the smiters and the builders and the judges, have
lived long and done sternly and yet preserved this lovely
character; and among our carpet interests and twopenny concerns,
the shame were indelible if <i>we</i> should lose it.&nbsp;
Gentleness and cheerfulness, these come before all morality; they
are the perfect duties.&nbsp; And it is the trouble with moral
men that they have neither one nor other.&nbsp; It was the moral
man, the Pharisee, whom Christ could not away with.&nbsp; If your
morals make you dreary, depend upon it they are wrong.&nbsp; I do
not say &ldquo;give them up,&rdquo; for they may be all you have;
but conceal them like a vice, lest they should spoil the lives of
better and simpler people.</p>
<p>A strange temptation attends upon man: to keep his eye on
pleasures, even when he will not share in them; to aim all his
morals against them.&nbsp; This very year a lady (singular
iconoclast!) proclaimed a crusade against dolls; and the racy
sermon against lust is a feature of the age.&nbsp; I venture to
call such moralists insincere.&nbsp; At any excess or perversion
of a natural appetite, their lyre sounds of itself with relishing
denunciations; but for all displays of the truly
diabolic&mdash;envy, malice, the mean lie, the mean silence, the
calumnious truth, the back-biter, the petty tyrant, the peevish
poisoner of family life&mdash;their standard is quite
different.&nbsp; These are wrong, they will admit, yet somehow
not so wrong; there is no zeal in their assault on them, no
secret element of gusto warms up the sermon; it is for things not
wrong in themselves that they reserve the choicest of their
indignation.&nbsp; A man may naturally disclaim all moral kinship
with the Reverend Mr. Zola or the hobgoblin old lady of the
dolls; for these are gross and naked instances.&nbsp; And yet in
each of us some similar element resides.&nbsp; The sight of a
pleasure in which we cannot or else will not share moves us to a
particular impatience.&nbsp; It may be because we are envious, or
because we are sad, or because we dislike noise and
romping&mdash;being so refined, or because&mdash;being so
philosophic&mdash;we have an over-weighing sense of life&rsquo;s
gravity: at least, as we go on in years, we are all tempted to
frown upon our neighbour&rsquo;s pleasures.&nbsp; People are
nowadays so fond of resisting temptations; here is one to be
resisted.&nbsp; They are fond of self-denial; here is a
propensity that cannot be too peremptorily denied.&nbsp; There is
an idea abroad among moral people that they should make their
neighbours good.&nbsp; One person I have to make good:
myself.&nbsp; But my duty to my neighbour is much more nearly
expressed by saying that I have to make him happy&mdash;if I
may.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Happiness and goodness, according to canting moralists, stand
in the relation of effect and cause.&nbsp; There was never
anything less proved or less probable: our happiness is never in
our own hands; we inherit our constitution; we stand buffet among
friends and enemies; we may be so built as to feel a sneer or an
aspersion with unusual keenness, and so circumstanced as to be
unusually exposed to them; we may have nerves very sensitive to
pain, and be afflicted with a disease very painful.&nbsp; Virtue
will not help us, and it is not meant to help us.&nbsp; It is not
even its own reward, except for the self-centred and&mdash;I had
almost said&mdash;the unamiable.&nbsp; No man can pacify his
conscience; if quiet be what he want, he shall do better to let
that organ perish from disuse.&nbsp; And to avoid the penalties
of the law, and the minor <i>capitis diminutio</i> of social
ostracism, is an affair of wisdom&mdash;of cunning, if you
will&mdash;and not of virtue.</p>
<p>In his own life, then, a man is not to expect happiness, only
to profit by it gladly when it shall arise; he is on duty here;
he knows not how or why, and does not need to know; he knows not
for what hire, and must not ask.&nbsp; Somehow or other, though
he does not know what goodness is, he must try to be good;
somehow or other, though he cannot tell what will do it, he must
try to give happiness to others.&nbsp; And no doubt there comes
in here a frequent clash of duties.&nbsp; How far is he to make
his neighbour happy?&nbsp; How far must he respect that smiling
face, so easy to cloud, so hard to brighten again?&nbsp; And how
far, on the other side, is he bound to be his brother&rsquo;s
keeper and the prophet of his own morality?&nbsp; How far must he
resent evil?</p>
<p>The difficulty is that we have little guidance; Christ&rsquo;s
sayings on the point being hard to reconcile with each other, and
(the most of them) hard to accept.&nbsp; But the truth of his
teaching would seem to be this: in our own person and fortune, we
should be ready to accept and to pardon all; it is <i>our</i>
cheek we are to turn, <i>our</i> coat that we are to give away to
the man who has taken <i>our</i> cloak.&nbsp; But when
another&rsquo;s face is buffeted, perhaps a little of the lion
will become us best.&nbsp; That we are to suffer others to be
injured, and stand by, is not conceivable and surely not
desirable.&nbsp; Revenge, says Bacon, is a kind of wild justice;
its judgments at least are delivered by an insane judge; and in
our own quarrel we can see nothing truly and do nothing
wisely.&nbsp; But in the quarrel of our neighbour, let us be more
bold.&nbsp; One person&rsquo;s happiness is as sacred as
another&rsquo;s; when we cannot defend both, let us defend one
with a stout heart.&nbsp; It is only in so far as we are doing
this, that we have any right to interfere: the defence of B is
our only ground of action against A.&nbsp; A has as good a right
to go to the devil, as we to go to glory; and neither knows what
he does.</p>
<p>The truth is that all these interventions and denunciations
and militant mongerings of moral half-truths, though they be
sometimes needful, though they are often enjoyable, do yet belong
to an inferior grade of duties.&nbsp; Ill-temper and envy and
revenge find here an arsenal of pious disguises; this is the
playground of inverted lusts.&nbsp; With a little more patience
and a little less temper, a gentler and wiser method might be
found in almost every case; and the knot that we cut by some fine
heady quarrel-scene in private life, or, in public affairs, by
some denunciatory act against what we are pleased to call our
neighbour&rsquo;s vices, might yet have been unwoven by the hand
of sympathy.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>To look back upon the past year, and see how little we have
striven and to what small purpose; and how often we have been
cowardly and hung back, or temerarious and rushed unwisely in;
and how every day and all day long we have transgressed the law
of kindness;&mdash;it may seem a paradox, but in the bitterness
of these discoveries, a certain consolation resides.&nbsp; Life
is not designed to minister to a man&rsquo;s vanity.&nbsp; He
goes upon his long business most of the time with a hanging head,
and all the time like a blind child.&nbsp; Full of rewards and
pleasures as it is&mdash;so that to see the day break or the moon
rise, or to meet a friend, or to hear the dinner-call when he is
hungry, fills him with surprising joys&mdash;this world is yet
for him no abiding city.&nbsp; Friendships fall through, health
fails, weariness assails him; year after year, he must thumb the
hardly varying record of his own weakness and folly.&nbsp; It is
a friendly process of detachment.&nbsp; When the time comes that
he should go, there need be few illusions left about
himself.&nbsp; <i>Here lies one who meant well</i>, <i>tried a
little</i>, <i>failed much</i>:&mdash;surely that may be his
epitaph, of which he need not be ashamed.&nbsp; Nor will he
complain at the summons which calls a defeated soldier from the
field: defeated, ay, if he were Paul or Marcus
Aurelius!&mdash;but if there is still one inch of fight in his
old spirit, undishonoured.&nbsp; The faith which sustained him in
his life-long blindness and life-long disappointment will scarce
even be required in this last formality of laying down his
arms.&nbsp; Give him a march with his old bones; there, out of
the glorious sun-coloured earth, out of the day and the dust and
the ecstasy&mdash;there goes another Faithful Failure!</p>
<p>From a recent book of verse, where there is more than one such
beautiful and manly poem, I take this memorial piece: it says
better than I can, what I love to think; let it be our parting
word.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A late lark twitters from the quiet
skies;<br />
And from the west,<br />
Where the sun, his day&rsquo;s work ended,<br />
Lingers as in content,<br />
There falls on the old, gray city<br />
An influence luminous and serene,<br />
A shining peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The smoke ascends<br />
In a rosy-and-golden haze.&nbsp; The spires<br />
Shine, and are changed.&nbsp; In the valley<br />
Shadows rise.&nbsp; The lark sings on.&nbsp; The sun,<br />
Closing his benediction,<br />
Sinks, and the darkening air<br />
Thrills with a sense of the triumphing night&mdash;<br />
Night, with her train of stars<br />
And her great gift of sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be my passing!<br />
My task accomplished and the long day done,<br />
My wages taken, and in my heart<br />
Some late lark singing,<br />
Let me be gathered to the quiet west,<br />
The sundown splendid and serene,<br />
Death.&rdquo; <a name="citation212"></a><a href="#footnote212"

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
